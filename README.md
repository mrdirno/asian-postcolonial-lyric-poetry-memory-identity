## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Liyana finds a poem scrawled in the margin of an old cookbook, revealing a secret her mother never spoke.
- Create a scene where the ghost of a colonial railway worker appears to Liyana on the night train, telling a story in a mix of Bahasa and English.
- Draft a lyrical interlude: a series of fragmented memories from Liyana's mother's perspective, structured as untitled poems.
- Write the encounter where Liyana meets a distant relative who holds a different, conflicting version of her mother's 'escape' from Penang.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Memory Map' of George Town: an interactive web experience where users click on locations (ferry, shophouse, temple) to unlock prose fragments, poems, and audio from the novel.
- Create a 'Lyric Generator' tool that uses thematic keywords from the novel (ash, water, taste, bridge, ghost) to assemble algorithmically-generated micro-poems in the style of the book's voice.
