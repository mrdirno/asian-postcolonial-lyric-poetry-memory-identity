## **Chapter 1**

The train from Kuala Lumpur to Butterworth smelled of diesel and dried squid. I pressed my forehead against the cool glass, watching the rubber plantations bleed into a green smear, the world dissolving into a Monet of my own exhaustion. My mother’s urn, a simple celadon ceramic, sat on the seat beside me, strapped in with the frayed seatbelt. It was a ridiculous sight. She would have hated it. *Like a tourist*, she’d have sniffed. *All that way to be buckled up like a child.*

“Ticket, Miss.”

The conductor’s fingers, stained with newsprint, tapped my shoulder. I handed him the slip. His eyes flicked to the urn, then back to me, his face a practiced blank. No curiosity, no pity. Just the transaction. I was grateful. For twenty-three hours, since the crematorium in KL had handed her to me in a brown paper bag—“*Abu, Puan*,” the ashes, Madam—I had been waiting for a sign. A crack of thunder. A ghostly whisper. The world to acknowledge that the most substantial person I had ever known was now three kilograms of granular grey matter in a pot.

Nothing. Just the clatter of the tracks, the hiss of doors, the murmur of Bahasa and Hokkien and Tamil weaving through the carriage.

She had died on a Tuesday. A massive, unsubtle stroke felling her in her own kitchen, her hand still clutching the *kuali* spatula, the garlic in the wok burning black. I got the call in my London flat, the rain streaking the windows like tears on a cheap postcard. The voice on the phone, my auntie’s, was sharp with practical grief. “*You come back now. She’s gone. No use crying there.*”

I hadn’t been crying. I’d been staring at a blank document on my screen, the cursor blinking like a failing heartbeat. A PhD thesis on “Postcolonial Hauntings in the Lyric Poetry of the Malay Archipelago.” A title that felt, in that moment, like a joke in the poorest taste. My mother, who had left Penang at nineteen for a nursing job in England, who had married my English father and then buried him five years later, who had raised me on stories of *kampung* ghosts and the taste of *nyonya* laksa she could never quite replicate in a London kitchen—she was my primary source. And she was gone. My archive had burned.

The train lurched, and the urn tilted. I shot out a hand to steady it. The ceramic was warm. From the sun, I told myself.

“Going home, ah?”

The old woman across the aisle leaned forward. She had the face of a kindly tortoise, wrinkles mapping a long life of sun and worry. Her *baju kurung* was crisp, lavender with tiny silver flowers.

“Not home,” I said. My voice was a rusted hinge. “My mother. I’m taking her home.”

The woman nodded, her eyes soft on the urn. “Good daughter. The journey is important. The road knows the weight you carry.”

“It’s just a train.”

She smiled, a gap where a lower tooth was missing. “You think so? This line, it runs on old bones. British bones, Japanese bones, Malay bones. They laid the tracks with stories. Your mother’s is just one more now. Light.”

I looked away, a sudden, stupid heat behind my eyes. I didn’t want her to be light. I wanted her to be heavy, solid, shouting at me to stand up straight, to eat more, to remember who I was. The weight of her absence was an anchor in my gut.

The woman offered me a wax-paper packet of *kuih lapis*, the steamed rainbow cake layered like sedimentary rock. I shook my head. “Thank you, no.”

“She make this for you? Your mother?”

“No. She made *achar*. Pickled vegetables. Hot enough to blister your tongue.”

“Ah.” The woman settled back, satisfied. “A strong taste. Means a strong life.”

The landscape shifted again, giving way to glimpses of the sea, a dull silver slab under the afternoon haze. Penang. *Pulau Pinang*. The Island of the Betel Nut. My mother’s stories painted it in mythic colours: the blue shutters of her childhood shophouse on Armenian Street, the scent of frangipani and sewage in the five-foot ways, the fierce green of the hills that cradled the island. A paradise. A prison. She escaped, she said. To make a better life. But every story she told was a stone from that island, carried in her pocket, worn smooth by the constant touch of memory.

I was born in the drizzle of Croydon. My name, Liyana, she chose for its melody, its Pan-Asian ambiguity. “It can be Malay, it can be Arabic, it can be just *you*,” she said. My father called me Lee. A compromise. I was a compromise. My skin the colour of milky tea, my features a vague map that people struggled to read. In England, I was “exotic.” In Malaysia, on our rare visits, I was *“anak mat salleh.”* The white man’s child. A tourist in my own bloodline.

The train began to slow, passing the backs of towns: concrete walls scrawled with graffiti, lines of washing like faded prayer flags, the skeletal frames of satellite dishes all pointing west. We were nearing the bridge. The link between the mainland and the island. My mother refused to cross it. On our last trip, a decade ago, she insisted we take the ferry.

“The bridge is for newcomers,” she said, her voice tight. “The ferry knows the water. The ferry remembers.”

“Remembers what?” I was fifteen, sullen, embarrassed by her superstitions.

She just looked out at the churning, muddy straits. “Everything.”

Now, I had no choice. The train went over the bridge. I held the urn tighter as we left the land and were suspended over the sea. The water below was the colour of old bruises. I thought of her ashes, mingled with the carbon of burnt wood and bone. If I opened the urn here, would the wind take her and scatter her over the straits of her childhood? Would that be right? Or was it just another kind of abandonment?

The tortoise woman was watching me. “You don’t know the way, do you?”

“To George Town? I have a map.”

“Not that way.” She waved a dismissive hand. “The other way. The way for her.”

“I’m taking her to the clan temple. On Armenian Street. Her family arranged it.”

“Family.” The word was a sigh. “They know the rituals. They don’t know the roads she walked. The secrets she swallowed.”

A chill, distinct from the train’s air-conditioning, crept up my spine. “What do you mean?”

But the train was pulling into Butterworth station, the final stop. The woman began gathering her things—a woven bag, a plastic carrier of pomelos. She moved with sudden urgency.

“Listen,” she said, leaning close. Her breath smelled of cloves and age. “Before you give her to the stone and the incense, you walk. You carry her. You let her see what changed, what stayed. You let her say goodbye on her own terms. The dead have their own journey. We are just the… the taxi.”

She pressed something into my hand—a small, cool object—before shuffling away with the stream of disembarking passengers. I looked down. In my palm lay a smooth, black river stone, worn to an oval. One side was painted with a single, tiny white eye.

I stood, clutching the urn in one arm, the stone in my other hand. The carriage was empty now, echoing with the ghosts of journey’s end. I stepped onto the platform, and the heat hit me like a wet fist. It was a physical memory: the weight of tropical air, the smell of exhaust, salt, and something sweetly rotting. The sound of it all—the motorbikes, the shouts, the untranslatable buzz of life—was a language I understood in my bones but could not speak.

I had a hotel booked in George Town. A taxi was the sensible thing. But the stone in my hand felt like a command. The old woman’s words echoed. *The dead have their own journey.*

I walked out of the station, the urn heavy against my hip. I would find the ferry terminal. I would cross the water the way she remembered. I would be her taxi.

The queue for the ferry was a slow, shuffling organism. I paid my few ringgit, the coins sticky in my hand. On the lower deck, I found a space by the rust-spotted railing. The engines shuddered to life, a deep, metallic groan, and we pulled away from the dock.

And then, as the mainland receded and the island of Penang rose before me—its hills hazy, its waterfront a jumble of colonial-era roofs and modern towers—the first ghost arrived.

Not my mother’s.

It was a smell. Cutting through the diesel and the brine: the unmistakable, cloying scent of *gardenia*. *Bunga cina*. My mother wore it. One drop, behind each ear, every Sunday. It was her church. The ferry churned the water, and the scent wrapped around me, so potent I could taste it on my tongue. I turned, half-expecting to see her standing there, her sharp eyes taking in the view.

There was only a young couple, the girl laughing, taking a selfie.

I looked down at the urn. The celadon glaze seemed to shimmer in the sea-light.

“Okay,” I whispered, the wind stealing my words. “Okay, I’m listening.”

The ferry pushed on, towards the island, towards the past, carrying the living, the dead, and me—the in-between thing, the scribe of ghosts, just beginning to understand that the story I had come to write was not in any book. It was in the pot in my arms, the stone in my pocket, and the gardenia-scented air that had followed me across the water.

My thesis was dead. This was something else. This was the beginning of an echo.

## **Chapter 2**

The shophouse on Armenian Street was not blue.

In my mother’s stories, it was always blue. A specific, piercing shade—*biru langit*, sky blue—that faded to a softer, memory blue by the time she finished describing the carved wooden shutters, the way the morning sun hit the second-floor window where she slept with three sisters. The house before me was a greenish-turquoise, peeling, the shutters a grimy brown. A faded red banner in Chinese characters hung above the door, next to a rusty air-conditioning unit dripping water onto the five-foot way.

Auntie Mei Leng stood in the open doorway, a small, compact woman in a floral-print blouse and polyester slacks. Her hair was a helmet of tight black curls. She held a broom, not as if she had been sweeping, but as a scepter of authority.

“Liyana. You are late.”

“The ferry, Auntie.”

“Hmm. The bridge is faster.” Her eyes, my mother’s eyes but harder, smaller, dropped to the urn. A flicker of something—pain, annoyance—crossed her face. “So. You brought her.”

It wasn’t a welcome. It was an assessment. I climbed the two steps, the familiar, forbidden thrill of stepping onto the covered walkway—the *kaki lima*—tingling in my feet. This was her ground. The space where she played hopscotch, where neighbours gossiped, where the itinerant Indian *mamak* would sell his *murukku* from a glass case.

“Come inside. Don’t let the heat in.”

I followed her into a dim, cool front room that served as a living area and a clan association office. A large, lacquered altar dominated the back wall, crowded with gold-framed ancestor photographs, cups of tea, and smouldering joss sticks. The smell was ancient: sandalwood, dust, and the faint, sweet decay of old paper. A ceiling fan chopped the thick air into lazy, warm slices.

“Put her there.” Auntie Mei pointed to a low rosewood table in front of the altar. “Careful.”

I knelt, placing the urn gently on the table. It looked alien here, this simple, elegant pot amidst the gilded clutter of generations. A placeholder. I felt a ridiculous urge to introduce it. *This is my mother. She liked Schubert and Stephen King novels and her gardenia perfume.*

“The ceremony is tomorrow at the temple. The monks are booked. Your cousins have ordered the food.” Auntie Mei spoke as if reading from a logistics report. “You will stay here. Upstairs. Your mother’s old room.”

“Thank you, Auntie.”

“Don’t thank me. It is duty.” She finally looked at me, really looked. “You look tired. And thin. London food is no good.”

“It’s fine.”

“Hmm. You have her nose. But your father’s colouring. Strange mix.” She said it not unkindly, but as a botanist might note an unusual hybrid. “The bathroom is out the back. Don’t use all the hot water. I will make tea.”

She disappeared through a beaded curtain into what I presumed was the kitchen. I was left alone with the ancestors. Their photographed eyes, sepia-toned and severe, seemed to track me. I recognized no one. My mother had escaped their gaze. And now I had brought her back into their dominion.

My backpack felt like an anchor. I shrugged it off, my fingers brushing against the river stone in my pocket. I took it out. The white eye stared up, a blind witness. *You let her see what changed.*

Auntie Mei returned with a tray: a chipped teapot, two handleless cups, and a plate of *onde-onde*, the glutinous rice balls rolled in coconut. The smell of the tea—a strong, smoky *pu-erh*—cut through the altar’s incense.

“Sit.”

I sat on a stiff, brocade-covered chair. She poured, the dark liquid arching neatly into the cup.

“Your mother,” she began, handing me the tea. “She was always difficult. Stubborn. Thought she was better than this place.” She took a loud sip. “She wrote to you? Told you stories?”

“Yes.”

“Good stories, I suppose. Romantic stories. She left out the boring parts. The hunger. The shame when our father lost the business. The smell of the gutter in July.” She bit into an *onde-onde*. “She painted a pretty picture and then she ran away from it. Easy.”

Anger, hot and sudden, rose in my throat. “She worked. She raised me alone. It wasn’t easy.”

Auntie Mei’s gaze was level. “I know what work is. I stayed. I looked after *their* ghosts.” She gestured with her chin towards the altar. “That is also work. That is also duty. She sent money. Big deal. Money doesn’t light incense. Money doesn’t remember birthdays of the dead.”

The silence that followed was filled by the whirring fan and the distant buzz of a motorbike. I drank my tea. It was bitter, earthy, a taste that anchored me to the floor.

“Why did she leave?” I asked, the question leaving me before I could shape it into something less direct.

Auntie Mei’s eyes narrowed. She studied me, as if deciding what version of the truth I could bear. “For a life. That’s what she said. A bigger life. She was smart. Pretty. She saw the walls of this street, this island, and she wanted to break them. Your father… the English nurse tutor… he was her ticket.” She said ‘ticket’ like it was a dirty word. “But a ticket is only one way. You can’t come back on the same ticket.”

“She came back to visit.”

“A visit is not a return. A visit is a… a inspection. She would walk these streets, her high heels clicking, her English daughter trailing behind, and she would judge. ‘This is new.’ ‘That is gone.’ Like a tourist. It hurt people.”

*It hurt you*, I thought but didn’t say.

“She wanted me to know where I came from,” I said, defensively.

“And do you?” The question was a needle.

I had no answer. I had a PhD topic. I had a head full of her curated memories. I had a genetic code that confused immigration officers. I had an urn.

Auntie Mei saw my silence. She nodded, a grim satisfaction there. “Tomorrow, after the temple, you will be free. You can go back to your big life. We will put her in the columbarium. It is clean, modern. She would like that. No fuss.”

The finality of it chilled me. It was so neat. Hand over the ashes, perform the rites, leave. A transaction, like the train conductor’s ticket punch. But the old woman’s warning, the gardenia on the ferry, the eye-stone burning a hole in my pocket—it all screamed that this was wrong. This was another kind of abandonment.

“I’d like to stay a few days,” I heard myself say. “To… see the island.”

Auntie Mei’s eyebrows lifted. “See what? The street art? The hipster cafes? That’s not Penang. That’s a postcard.”

“I’d like to walk. To see the places she talked about.”

For the first time, something softened, almost imperceptibly, around her mouth. It wasn’t warmth. It was pity. “Ah. You want the ghost tour. Okay. Why not? But the room is only free until Saturday. Then we have a clan meeting.”

She stood, collecting the cups. The audience was over. “Your room is upstairs. First door on the left. Don’t touch the things in the glass cabinet on the landing. They are not souvenirs.”

The staircase was steep, the wood groaning under my weight. The air grew hotter, denser. On the landing, as warned, stood a glass-fronted cabinet. Inside were not precious heirlooms, but a collection of mundane, melancholy objects: a tarnished silver hairpin, a broken spectacles case, a dried sea star, a tiny, leather-bound diary with a rusted clasp. The museum of small forgettings.

The first door on the left was warped, painted a long-faded pink. I pushed it open.

The room was small, dominated by a single bed with a mosquito net tied up in a knot like a ghost’s shroud. A simple wooden desk sat under the window, which looked out onto the back alley and the blank wall of the next shophouse. The air was stifling, trapped. This was her room. The space where a girl named Lim Su Mei dreamed of escape.

And she had left traces. Not in objects—Auntie Mei would have cleared those—but in the atmosphere. A faint, lingering resonance. I could feel it. A restless intelligence humming in the plaster. I placed my backpack on the bed and the urn on the desk, facing the window. *So you can see*, I thought.

I opened the window, needing air. The sounds of the alley rushed in: a clatter of pans, a snatch of radio news, a child crying. Life, immediate and unconcerned with the past.

In my bag, my phone buzzed. A message from my thesis supervisor, Malcolm. *“Hope you’re holding up, Liyana. The faculty sends condolences. Do give a thought to your submission timeline when you’re able. No rush, of course, but the clock is ticking.”*

The clock. The tidy, academic clock measuring out a life in footnotes and deadlines. I put the phone away, screen down.

I took out the river stone and placed it beside the urn. The two objects sat together, a silent conversation. One to hold ashes, one to see with a painted eye.

What had the old woman meant, *the secrets she swallowed*?

I lay down on the bed, the iron frame creaking. The ceiling was stained with old water marks, shapes like unfamiliar continents. I closed my eyes, and the ghosts arrived not as visions, but as sounds. The clack of her heels on the five-foot way. Her laughter, a sound I realized I was already starting to forget the true pitch of. The sizzle of garlic in the *kuali*.

I had come to return her. But I was beginning to understand that I was here to listen. To translate. The first tension had been set: between Auntie Mei’s dutiful, final ritual and the insistent, whispering pull of an unfinished journey. My mother’s story was not a closed book. It was an archive waiting to be breathed open. And I, the confused archivist, was locked in her childhood room, with only a pot of ashes and a seeing stone for guides.

The fan turned, useless against the heat. Outside, Penang buzzed and blared. Somewhere in the weave of it, my mother’s ghost was walking. And tomorrow, I would have to decide whether to bury her, or to follow.

## **Chapter 3**

The clan temple was a riot of noise and colour, a sensory assault that left no room for quiet grief. Giant coils of incense hung from the high ceiling, smouldering like angry hornets’ nests, raining fine ash. The air was a solid fog of sandalwood and orchid offerings. Gold-painted deities with furious, benevolent faces looked down from alcoves, while monks in saffron robes chanted sutras into wireless microphones, their amplified voices competing with the clatter of mahjong tiles from a back room.

Auntie Mei, now dressed in a severe black *samfu*, thrust three joss sticks into my hand. “Follow me. Bow when I bow. Don’t touch the altar.”

My cousins—a blur of polite smiles and modern haircuts—nodded at me. I was the curious relic, the half-blood from afar who had brought the prodigal aunt home. The urn was placed on the main altar, between a plate of pomelos and a roasted pig with a apple in its mouth. It looked absurd. My mother, who found organised religion faintly ridiculous, would have hated this theatrical send-off.

The head monk, a man with a kind face and an iPhone peeking from his robe, began the ceremony. The chanting rose and fell, a rhythmic drone that vibrated in my sternum. I tried to feel something—sorrow, closure, connection. But I felt only detachment, a scholar’s observation of ritual. I was studying my own mother’s funeral. This, I realized with a sick jolt, was the true haunt. Not her ghost, but my own alienation.

Auntie Mei elbowed me. “Bow.”

I bowed. When I rose, my eyes stung from the smoke. Through the haze, across the crowded temple hall, I saw her.

Not my mother. The old woman from the train.

She stood by a side door, out of place in a simple, faded *baju kurung*, not mourning clothes. Her tortoise face was serene. She held a single, white chrysanthemum. And she was looking directly at me. She didn’t smile. She gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod towards the urn, then towards the door behind her. Then she turned and slipped out into the blinding daylight.

My heart thumped against my ribs. A coincidence. A strange, island coincidence.

The chanting reached a crescendo. The monk sprinkled holy water on the urn. Auntie Mei began to weep, a dry, shuddering sound without tears. It was the most vulnerable I had ever seen her. The ceremony was ending. The finality of it pressed down on me. Once they took that urn to the columbarium—that clean, modern niche—the door would shut. Literally and figuratively. The archive would be sealed.

The old woman’s nod was a hook in my mind. *The secrets she swallowed.*

As the monks began to pack up their instruments and my cousins moved towards the food tables, I acted. It wasn’t a thought; it was a current that pulled me. I stepped forward, ahead of Auntie Mei.

“Excuse me,” I said to the head monk, my voice surprisingly steady. “Before the interment… my mother’s wishes. There’s a specific place. One last visit. A private moment.”

Auntie Mei’s tearless crying stopped. She stared at me, confusion hardening into suspicion. “What wishes? She made no such instructions.”

“She told me,” I lied, the words ash in my mouth. “On her last visit to London. She was very clear. A place by the sea. It was… personal.”

“What place? Which sea?”

“I have the directions,” I said, the lie building its own architecture. “It won’t take long. I’ll take her. Alone. It was her last request.”

A silent battle passed between us, there in the smoky temple. To challenge me was to disrespect the dead’s final wishes, a powerful taboo. Auntie Mei’s eyes flicked to the urn, to the monk’s placid face, to my cousins watching this unexpected drama. Her authority, so solid in the shophouse, was porous here, in the realm of ritual and sentiment.

The monk saved her. “The departed’s peace is paramount,” he intoned. “If the daughter knows the way, let her complete the journey. The niche will wait.”

Auntie Mei’s jaw tightened. She gave a sharp, furious nod. “One hour. Then you bring her to the columbarium. The booking is at four.” It was a command, a line in the sand.

“I will.”

I moved to the altar, picked up the celadon urn. It was warm from the incense, from the proximity of all that focused energy. I cradled it, feeling the gaze of my family, the deities, the ancestors. I was stealing their dead.

I walked out of the temple, from the dim, smoky roar into the white-hot hammer of the afternoon sun. I blinked, disoriented. The street was a cacophony of traffic and tourists. I had no plan, no directions, no “place by the sea.” I had an urn, a stone, and one hour.

And then I saw the chrysanthemum. A single white bloom, lying on the bonnet of a parked, dusty Proton car. It hadn’t been there a moment before. I looked up and down the street. No old woman. But there, maybe fifty yards down, tucked into the handle of a trishaw, was another. A trail. A ghost trail.

A wild, desperate hope surged in me. I followed.

The flowers led me away from the tourist-thronged core, down narrower, quieter streets. The grand shophouses gave way to weathered, residential ones. Laundry hung like faded flags. The smell changed: less incense, more damp concrete, frying shallots, the faint, sweet decay of overripe fruit. The chrysanthemums appeared with just enough frequency to keep me moving: on a low wall, at the base of a rain tree, tied to the gate of a Chinese school.

I was in a part of George Town I didn’t know, that no guidebook would recommend. The trail ended at a rusted, corrugated-iron gate. It blocked the entrance to a narrow *lorong*, an alley that ran between two rows of backyards. No flower here. Just the gate, slightly ajar.

This was it. The “place by the sea” was a dirty alley.

Doubt flooded me. This was madness. I was following floral breadcrumbs left by a strange old woman, jeopardising my relationship with my only remaining family, all based on a feeling. I checked my phone. Forty minutes left.

I pushed the gate. It screeched in protest.

The alley was a tunnel of green gloom, shaded by rambutan trees growing from the neighbouring compounds. The air was cooler, smelling of wet earth and moss. At the far end, a crack of brilliant light—the sea.

I walked, the urn held tight. The backs of the houses were raw: exposed plumbing, cracked tiles, stacks of broken furniture. A chicken clucked behind a wire fence. At the end, the alley opened onto a tiny, forgotten scrap of land, a buffer between the last house and the sea. It wasn’t a beach. It was a rough, rocky breakwater, littered with plastic bottles and weathered styrofoam. The sea here was a sluggish, brownish green, slapping against the stones. Across the strait, the mainland was a grey smudge.

It was a dismal, forgotten spot. And yet.

I knew it. Not from visiting, but from description. The specific curve of the breakwater, the particular view of a distant, lone factory chimney on the opposite shore. My mother had described this place. Not in her romantic stories, but once, in a rare, unguarded moment of sadness. She’d called it her “thinking spot.” Where she came to be alone, to look at the horizon and dream of the other side.

“This is it, isn’t it?” I whispered to the urn.

I sat on a relatively flat rock, placing her beside me. The water lapped. A mynah bird scolded from a TV antenna. This was no picturesque farewell. It was real, ugly, and profoundly hers.

I took the river stone from my pocket. The painted eye stared at the sea. I understood now. This wasn’t about a scenic goodbye. This was about context. This was the view she had when she decided to leave.

“What secret did you swallow here?” I asked the air, the water, the ashes.

The answer didn’t come in words. It came as a memory, not mine, but one rising from the very stones. I felt a young woman’s frustration, a sharp, intelligent hunger that this island could not satisfy. The secret wasn’t a scandal. It was a choice. The choice to amputate a part of herself to save the whole. The choice to trade the known, claustrophobic love of this place for the terrifying possibility of a bigger self. She swallowed the guilt, the judgement, the “what if,” and she boarded the ship.

And she never made peace with it. That was the haunting. Not a ghost, but an unresolved chord.

I looked at the urn. “You didn’t want to come back to this spot, did you? You wanted *me* to see it.”

The understanding was a physical shift inside me. My thesis was about ghosts in poetry. But the real haunting was in the geography of choice. In the landscapes we flee and the ones we can never fully inhabit.

A shadow fell across me. I turned, expecting the old woman.

It was Auntie Mei. She stood at the mouth of the alley, her face unreadable. She must have followed me.

She walked over, her steps careful on the uneven rocks. She didn’t look at me. She looked at the view, her eyes tracing the same horizon her sister had.

“She came here the night before she left,” Auntie Mei said, her voice quiet, stripped of its earlier sharpness. “I followed her then, too. I begged her not to go. She said this place was too small for her heart.” She paused, swallowing hard. “I said her heart was too big for her own good. We never spoke of it again.”

The confession hung between us, mingling with the salt air.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “For lying.”

“I know why you did.” She finally looked at me, and for the first time, I saw my mother in her face—not the hard, practical mask, but the girl who had stood on these rocks. “You have her stubbornness. And her sentimentality. A dangerous mix.”

She reached out, not for the urn, but placed a hand briefly, awkwardly, on my shoulder. The touch was electric. A connection, not through blood, but through shared, complicated love for the same difficult, magnificent woman.

“The columbarium,” I said. “We’ll be late.”

Auntie Mei shook her head. She looked at the urn, then at the sea. “Let them wait. The booking is just a time. This…” She gestured at the water, the sky, the moment. “This is more important.”

We sat together on the rocks, two generations of women, holding the silence between us. The first major complication had arrived: I had fractured the family’s plan. But in doing so, I had stumbled into a deeper, messier truth. The journey wasn’t about returning her ashes. It was about understanding her departure. And mine.

The sea breathed in and out. The secret wasn’t swallowed anymore. It was here, between us, being slowly digested by the salt and the wind and the living. The ghost was starting to speak. And I, the daughter, was finally learning how to listen.

# Chapter 4

## **Chapter 4**

The columbarium in Batu Maung was a white, tiered monstrosity, a wedding cake baked for the dead. It gleamed under a punishing sun, each numbered niche a tiny, square mouth waiting to be fed. The family car—Uncle Hock’s sensible beige Proton—was already parked in the sliver of shade by the entrance. Two figures stood beside it, their postures rigid with waiting. The scheduled time had come and gone. The fracture was now a visible crack.

Auntie Mei and I walked up from the coastal path, the urn a shared weight in my hands. The sea’s breath was still on our skin, a damp saltiness that felt more like a baptism than the air-conditioned sanctity we were approaching. Her confession had settled in my chest, a warm, heavy stone. My mother had stood on those rocks, her heart a wild, unmanageable thing. I carried the echo of it now, and it made the clinical white of the columbarium seem obscene.

“Ah. There she is.” Uncle Hock’s voice was a flat blade. He was a compact man, his displeasure held in the tight line of his shoulders, the way his arms were crossed over his polo shirt. Beside him stood my cousin, Jian. Early twenties, hair gelled into submission, eyes fixed on his phone—a portrait of studied disengagement. He was the son, the heir, the one who had never left.

Auntie Mei’s mask of practicality slid back into place, but it sat differently now. A choice, not a reflex. “We took a detour.”

“A detour.” Uncle Hock’s laugh was a short, dry cough. “The monk is inside. The booking was for ten. It is now ten-twenty. This is not a tourist itinerary, Li Ann.”

He used my Chinese name, a subtle reclamation of authority. I felt the urn’s celadon surface, cool under my fingers. *Like a tourist*, my mother’s ghost sniffed. I straightened. “We needed a moment.”

“*We*,” Jian echoed, not looking up. His thumbs danced on his screen. “Since when is it a ‘we’?”

The question hung in the thick air. The family unit, realigned by a ceramic jar and a missed appointment. Auntie Mei said nothing, but she didn’t move to their side. She remained a half-step behind me, a silent, monumental shift.

“Let’s not make more of a scene,” Uncle Hock said, turning toward the entrance. “The paperwork is already a headache. Because of the… delay.”

The interior was a shock of cold. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, reflecting off polished marble floors that smelled of lemon disinfectant and incense. Rows upon rows of niches climbed to the high ceiling, a silent, numbered city. Some were sealed with marble plaques, smiling photographs etched forever. Others were dark, empty mouths. Our footsteps echoed, a funereal tap-tap-tap that seemed to measure out the remainder of my mother’s journey.

The monk was young, his saffron robes bright against the sterile white. He looked bored. He held a tablet, scrolling. “Sector D, level four, niche 288,” he said, his voice a monotone. “You are late. The next booking is at ten-forty.”

“Our apologies, venerable sir,” Uncle Hock said, his tone oiled with a respect he hadn’t shown me.

The monk led us to a bank of elevators. The ride was silent, cramped. Jian stared at the ascending numbers. Auntie Mei watched the urn. Uncle Hock watched me.

Sector D was a long, narrow gallery. The air was still and faintly dusty. Niche 288 was at eye level. A simple, empty square. The final transaction.

The monk began a rapid, melodic chant, the words Pali and perfunctory. He gestured for the urn. My fingers tightened. This was the script: hand over the ashes, accept the sealed niche, light some joss sticks, go home. A neat end to a messy life.

But the stone from the cove was still warm in my chest. The image of my mother, not as a ghost in an urn, but as a living woman staring at a horizon too small for her heart.

“Wait.”

The chant faltered. Uncle Hock’s head swiveled toward me. Jian finally put his phone away.

“I’m not putting her in there.”

The words were out, quiet but clear, dissolving the chant’s last syllable. The monk blinked, his bureaucratic rhythm broken.

“Li Ann,” Uncle Hock hissed. “What nonsense is this now?”

“It’s not nonsense.” I looked at the niche, then at him. “She hated small, dark places. She hated being told where to be. You know that.”

“She is *ashes*,” Jian said, a sneer in his voice. “She doesn’t hate anything.”

Auntie Mei was silent, but her eyes were on me, bright and unblinking.

“The booking is made,” Uncle Hock said, his voice low, dangerous. “The payment is processed. This is what we agreed. This is what is proper.”

“You agreed,” I said. “I never did.”

The monk cleared his throat. “There is a forfeiture fee for cancellation. And the next of kin form you signed in KL…”

“I am the next of kin.” The words felt new, a mantle I hadn’t known how to wear. “And I’m not cancelling. I’m changing the plan.”

The confrontation was a low, tense thing, there in the fluorescent-lit gallery of the dead. Uncle Hock argued propriety, face, the practicalities. Jian muttered about wasted time and melodrama. The monk quoted policy. Through it all, I held the urn, my knuckles white. My mother’s stubbornness, her sentimentality. A dangerous mix.

It was Auntie Mei who broke the stalemate. Her voice, when it came, was not loud, but it cut through the men’s frustration. “My sister was afraid of the dark. As a girl, she slept with the lamp on. Even later, in her own house. She kept all the windows open.” She looked at Uncle Hock, her gaze steady. “You remember, Hock. You used to tease her for it.”

A memory, weaponized. He flinched, the hard line of his jaw softening for a fraction of a second. The shared past, the childhood detail—it was unassailable.

The monk, sensing a family dispute that would not be resolved by his tablet, sighed. “You can take the urn. The niche can be held for forty-eight hours. After that, forfeiture.” He looked at me. “The ashes cannot be kept… loosely. It is not legal.”

“I understand,” I said.

We left the columbarium, the tension now a physical entity in the car. The urn sat on my lap, the seatbelt around it again. A tourist, buckled up. But the destination was unknown.

Uncle Hock drove, his silence a thick, angry fog. Jian slouched in the passenger seat, radiating contempt. “So what’s the grand plan?” he asked, not turning around. “Scatter her in a shopping mall? Release her into the wild?”

“Jian,” Auntie Mei warned from beside me.

“No, it’s a fair question,” I said, staring out at the passing shops, the motorbikes, the ordinary world that had no place for my crisis. “I don’t know yet.”

But that was a lie. A shape was forming, born from the rocks and the salt air. If her departure was the key, then I had to trace it. Not end it here, in this town she fled, but follow the path she took. The ghost was speaking. I needed to hear the whole story.

***

Uncle Hock’s house was a narrow two-story terrace, its front plastered with greenish tiles that swallowed the light. Inside, it was all dark wood and the faint, permanent smell of mothballs and fried garlic. My mother’s absence was a presence here, a ghost in the family photos from which she’d been carefully excised—a jagged cut-out, a sun-bleached rectangle on the wall where her face should have been.

I was given the back room, a space that felt more like a storage closet with a single bed. Suitcases and old textbooks were piled in one corner. The window looked out onto the blank wall of the next house. A small, dark place.

I set the urn on the lone desk. It looked alien here, this elegant, sorrowful object amidst the dust and clutter. The first challenge was immediate: I could not stay here. Not just in this house, with its silent accusations and curated memories, but in this state of paralysis. I had pulled her from the niche, but I had nowhere to go.

A soft knock. Auntie Mei entered without waiting, carrying two glasses of barley water. She handed one to me, her eyes on the urn.

“He is angry,” she said, meaning Uncle Hock. “But it is not all about face. He loved her, in his way. Her leaving… it broke something in the family logic. He has spent twenty years trying to glue it back together with rules. You arriving with her, then breaking the rules… it is a second fracture.”

“I didn’t mean to break anything.”

“You are her daughter. You cannot help it.” She took a sip, her gaze distant. “You need a story. For them. For why you are keeping the ashes.”

“I have a story. I just don’t know the ending.”

“Then find the beginning.” She set her glass down. “She kept a box. When she left, she gave it to me. Told me to burn it. I didn’t.” A faint, guilty smile touched her lips. “Sentimentality. It runs in the family, it seems.”

My heart thumped once, hard. “Where is it?”

“In my room. Under my bed. A tin box, with roses on it.” She stood to leave, pausing at the door. “He will ask what you are doing tomorrow. Tell him you are going to Georgetown. To be a tourist. It is a good lie. It has truth in it.”

After she left, the room felt charged. The past was not just memories in the air; it was a physical object, under a bed, waiting. I waited for the house to settle into the deep, resonant silence of night—Uncle Hock’s snore from the front room, the creak of Jian shifting in his sleep. Then I slipped out.

Auntie Mei’s room was at the top of the stairs, spartan and clean. The box was right where she said, a rectangular biscuit tin, its painted roses faded to a ghostly pink. It was lighter than I expected.

I took it back to my room, the tin cold in my hands. Sitting on the edge of the hard bed, I lifted the lid.

The smell hit me first—not mothballs, but sandalwood and old paper, the scent of my mother’s childhood. There were no diaries, no dramatic letters. Instead, a collection of fragments: a postcard of the Sydney Opera House, blank on the back. A dried frangipani blossom, brittle as parchment. A train ticket from Butterworth to Bangkok, third class, dated 1998. A black-and-white photo of two girls on the rocks at the cove, arms slung around each other’s shoulders, squinting into the sun. My mother and Auntie Mei, young, their faces unlined by regret or resentment.

And at the bottom, a map. A tourist map of Penang, creased and soft from folding. On the back, in my mother’s familiar, looping hand, was not a letter, but a list. A series of numbers and letters, like a code:

*G7 - 3pm - the keeper remembers*
*C4 - ask for the red basket*
*L12 - sunset is best*

Coordinates. Not geographical, but personal. A treasure map of her island, left behind in a box she asked to be burned.

This was the first skill I needed to learn: how to read her. Not her words, but her omissions. Her trail of breadcrumbs. The challenge was no longer just logistical or emotional; it was cryptographic. I traced the faded lines of the map with my finger. G7. C4. L12. The ghost was not just speaking; she had left a guidebook.

***

Georgetown in the morning was a slap of heat and noise. I’d told Uncle Hock I was going to see the street art, to be a proper visitor. He’d grunted, a sound of dismissal and relief. My absence was easier than my presence.

The map was in my bag, the tin box left hidden under my own bed. G7 corresponded to a grid near the clan jetties, the old wooden waterfront settlements built out over the water. Numbered piers, each belonging to a different family association. The air here was thick with the smell of brine and frying noodles, the wooden planks groaning underfoot. I found Jetty G, a quieter, more dilapidated pier.

*3pm - the keeper remembers.*

It was just past two. I wandered, feeling conspicuous. The houses on the jetty were packed close, life spilling out of doors: old men mending nets, women sorting dried shrimp, children chasing cats. At the very end, where the water slapped against mossy stilts, was a small shrine to Tua Pek Kong, the earth deity. An old man sat on a stool beside it, whittling a piece of driftwood.

I bought a can of iced chrysanthemum tea from a nearby stall and waited, leaning on the railing, watching the ferries chug across the channel to Butterworth. The train I’d arrived on was probably there, being cleaned, restocked with diesel and dried squid for its return journey.

At five minutes to three, the old man looked up. Not at me, but at the water. He put down his whittling, stood with a soft groan, and lit a bundle of joss sticks at the shrine. He placed them in the holder, the smoke weaving a blue thread in the heavy air.

“You are early,” he said, in Mandarin. He still didn’t look at me.

My pulse jumped. “How did you know I was waiting?”

“You stand like her. One hip out, head tilted. Like you’re listening to a song no one else can hear.” He finally turned. His face was a landscape of wrinkles, his eyes milky with cataracts. “You have her urn?”

The question was so direct it stole my breath. “Yes.”

He nodded, as if I’d confirmed the weather. “She said one day a girl would come. With a green jar. She paid me, long time ago.” He gestured to a red offering box by the shrine. “To keep the joss sticks burning for her. And to give a message, when the girl came.”

“What’s the message?”

He smiled, a gap-toothed thing. “Not a message. A question.” He leaned closer, his voice dropping. “She asked me to ask you: *Are you running from, or running to?*”

The world narrowed to the smell of incense, the lap of water, the old man’s sightless gaze. It was my mother’s voice, channeled through this stranger on a rotting pier. The central question of her life, now passed to me.

“I don’t know,” I whispered, an honest answer to a ghost.

“Good,” he said. “If you knew, you wouldn’t need to ask.” He reached into the pocket of his threadbare shirt and pulled out a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. “For you.”

I took it. Unwrapped it. Inside was a tiny, carved wooden boat, no longer than my thumb, its sail a scrap of faded red cloth. Exquisitely detailed.

“She carved it,” the old man said. “Sitting right here. Said it was the boat that would take her away. But she left it behind.” He turned back to the water, his audience over. “G7 is done. Go to C4.”

I clutched the little boat, its wood smooth from years of handling. My first ally was not a person, but a network—my mother’s past, scattered across the island in the memories of keepers. This old man, with his carved driftwood and his burning joss sticks, was the first node. His knowledge was complementary to mine; he held the past, I carried the present. Together, we were starting to map the shape of her departure.

***

C4 was the Central Market, a sprawling, cacophonous hall of scents and shouts. *Ask for the red basket.* I moved through the stalls of dried seafood, spices piled in vibrant mounds, bolts of batik, feeling utterly lost. Finally, in a quieter corner dedicated to basket weaving and rattan goods, I saw it. Hanging from a hook: a basket, dyed a deep, lacquered red.

The woman behind the stall was my mother’s age, maybe older, her hair in a severe bun, her hands constantly moving, stripping cane. She watched me approach, her eyes sharp.

“*Moi*,” she said in Cantonese. *Little sister.* “You look like you’re searching for more than a basket.”

“I was told to ask for the red one.”

Her hands stilled. “By who?”

“The keeper at G7.”

A long, assessing look. Then she nodded, once. She took the basket down. It was not for sale. It was a vessel. Inside was a single, sealed envelope. And beneath it, lining the bottom, was a layer of coarse, grey sand.

“She left this, maybe… twenty-five years ago,” the woman said. “Paid for a lifetime of storage. I thought she was crazy. But the money was good.” She pushed the basket toward me. “The envelope is for you. The sand… she said it was for remembering where you come from, even when you’re standing somewhere else.”

I opened the envelope. No letter. Just a photograph. A picture of my mother, younger than I’d ever known her, standing on a vast, unfamiliar beach, her hair wild in the wind. She was smiling, but it wasn’t a happy smile. It was a fierce, challenging grin, aimed at the camera. On the back, two words: ***Bondi. 1999.***

Australia. A year after the Bangkok train ticket. She’d made it.

“She was trouble, that one,” the weaver said, a hint of fondness in her voice. “Full of dreams that were too big for this island. We all thought she’d crash. But she kept flying.” She looked at me. “You have her eyes. The same storm in them.”

I took the basket, the weight of the sand profound. This was my mother’s life, parceled out in fragments across her hometown. A carved boat she left behind. Sand from a beach a continent away. She was showing me her journey, piece by piece. And with each piece, the nature of the true antagonist became clearer. It wasn’t Uncle Hock, or propriety, or even death. It was the sheer, daunting scale of her ambition, her restlessness. The shadow I was chasing was vast. It had spanned oceans. How could my small, confused heart hope to contain it?

The weaver became my second ally. “She talked about a man,” she said, lowering her voice. “Here, before she left. A foreigner. A teacher. He was the match, I think. Lit the fire that was already there.” She shrugged. “Or maybe he was just an excuse. With her, it was hard to tell.”

A foreign teacher. A new thread. The plot was thickening, the scope widening from a family dispute to a love story, an escape plan, a life fully lived beyond these shores. I was no longer just settling ashes; I was reconstructing a migration.

***

L12 was listed as *Lorong 12*, a residential lane in a quiet, leafy suburb. *Sunset is best.* I arrived as the sky was beginning to soften, the fierce blue bleeding into apricot. The lane was lined with old bungalows, set back behind walls and wrought-iron gates. Number L12 was at the end, a house that seemed asleep, its garden overgrown, its paint peeling.

There was no keeper here. No basket. Just the house.

I stood at the gate, the red basket on my arm, the little boat in my pocket. This was the last coordinate on the list. The culmination. The sunset painted the upper windows gold.

A car pulled up silently behind me. A sleek, silver Mercedes. I turned, expecting another cryptic elder.

The man who got out was in his fifties, dressed in tailored linen, his hair silver at the temples. He was not Malaysian. European, perhaps. He carried an air of quiet authority, and his eyes, a pale blue, fixed on me with an intensity that felt like a physical touch.

“You found it,” he said. His English was accented, cultured. “I wondered if anyone ever would.”

Every instinct went taut. “Who are you?”

“My name is Karl.” He came to stand beside me, looking at the house, not at me. “I used to live here. A long time ago. I was a teacher at the international school.” He paused. “I knew your mother.”

The weaver’s words echoed. *A foreigner. A teacher. The match.*

“She left this address?”

“She left many things,” he said softly. Then he looked at me, and his gaze was full of a sorrow so deep it seemed to predate me. “She was the most alive person I have ever known. It was like holding a lightning bolt. Beautiful. Impossible to keep.”

“Why is this address on her map?”

“Because this is where she decided to leave.” He unlocked the gate with a key from his pocket. It swung open with a creak. “Not Penang. Me.”

He led me up the overgrown path. The house was unlocked. Inside, it was empty, save for a fine layer of dust and the ghosts of furniture. The last of the sunset streamed through the back windows, illuminating a large, empty room that looked out onto a wild, neglected garden.

“We were going to go together,” Karl said, his voice echoing in the emptiness. “To Australia. I had a position in Sydney. We had plans. But at the last moment… she changed her mind. She said if she went with me, it would become my adventure, not hers. She needed it to be hers alone.” He smiled, a sad, private thing. “She left from this house. I drove her to the train station. She had one bag. And that fearless, terrible smile.”

I could see her here, in this empty space, making the choice that would define everything. Choosing the unknown over a safe, shared path. Her stubbornness. Her sentimentality for her own destiny.

“She loved you,” I said, not knowing if it was true, but feeling it in the dust-moted air.

“I know,” he said. “And I loved her. That’s why I let her go.” He turned to me fully now. “You have her ashes.”

“Yes.”

“She wouldn’t want them here. Or in that columbarium.” He reached into his jacket and pulled out a key, placing it in my palm. It was old, tarnished brass, attached to a fob shaped like a kangaroo. “This is for a storage locker. At the bus station in Sydney. Unit 114. She left a few things there, she told me. In case she ever wanted to remember. Or in case someone like you ever came looking.”

The true scope of the opposition was now fully revealed. It was not a person, but a legacy of immense, solitary courage. It was an entire life lived on the other side of a choice I could barely comprehend. To follow her now meant not just tracing her path, but confronting the sheer audacity of it. Could I, with my frayed seatbelts and my tourist uncertainties, ever understand?

Karl was my third ally, the one who held the key to the next continent. His knowledge was the bridge. “Thank you,” I said, the key burning in my hand.

“Don’t thank me,” he said. “The journey is yours now. And it will cost you.”

***

The cost came due that night.

Uncle Hock was waiting in the living room when I returned. The house was dark, save for one lamp. The urn was on the coffee table. He had taken it from my room.

He held the rose tin box in his hands.

My blood turned to ice. “That’s mine.”

“Nothing in this house is *yours*,” he said, his voice trembling with a fury he’d banked all day. “You come here. You disrupt. You dishonor our arrangements. And you *snoop*.” He opened the tin, dumping its contents onto the table. The postcard, the flower, the ticket, the photo, the map. He picked up the map, saw the writing on the back. His face darkened. “What is this? Some childish treasure hunt? While your mother’s ashes wait?”

“It’s her,” I said, my own anger rising, hot and defensive. “It’s where she was. Who she was. It’s more real than any niche in that wall!”

“It is *nostalgia*!” he shouted, the word a curse. “It is her selfishness, poisoning another generation!” He took the map in both hands.

“No!”

The rip was a shockingly loud sound in the quiet room. He tore it once, twice, across the grids, through the coordinates G7, C4, L12. He tore the photo of the two sisters. He crumpled the postcard and the ticket.

I stood frozen, watching the fragments of my mother’s trail scatter across the polished wood like ashes. The betrayal was absolute. It wasn’t just a miscalculation of leaving the box vulnerable; it was a failure to understand the depth of his hurt, his need to control the narrative of her life and now her death.

“The columbarium will hold the niche until tomorrow,” he said, breathless with the effort of his destruction. “You will take her there. You will do your duty. And then you will leave. This family cannot survive her chaos a second time.”

He left the room, leaving me amidst the ruins.

The setback was total. The map was gone. The physical trail, destroyed. The fragile trust with the family, obliterated. I had lost the guidebook just as I’d learned to read it. I gathered the torn pieces, my hands shaking. The personal stakes were no longer about understanding; they were about survival. If I capitulated now, my mother’s last journey—and my own—would end in a numbered hole, dictated by a man whose love had curdled into control.

But as I sifted through the pieces, my fingers found the tiny wooden boat in my pocket. And in the red basket by my feet, the sand from Bondi, the photo of her fierce smile. And in my palm, the cold brass key to a locker in Sydney.

Uncle Hock could tear paper. He could not tear the memories lodged in the keepers, the sand, the key. He could not tear the resolve now hardening inside me, forged in the heat of his betrayal.

The ghost had spoken through others. She had shown me her departure. Now, she was asking me to choose.

I looked at the shattered map, then at the urn. The journey was not about returning her ashes. It was about completing her journey. And mine.

I began to pack, quietly. Not to run from, but to run to. The path was broken, but the destination was finally clear. I would take her to Sydney. To locker 114. To the beach in the photograph. I would follow the lightning bolt all the way home.

But as I zipped my bag closed, a floorboard creaked outside my door. A shadow paused in the crack of light underneath. Someone was listening. The fracture in the family had become a chasm, and not everyone wanted me to cross it.

# Chapter 5

## **Chapter 5**

The house held its breath. The silence after Uncle Hock’s departure was not empty; it was a saturated thing, thick with the ghosts of his fury and the dust of the shredded map. I moved through it like a diver in deep water, each motion slow, deliberate, weighted. The act of packing was a liturgy. Each item—a shirt, a toothbrush, the cold celadon urn—was a word in a silent prayer of defiance.

The sand from Bondi was the first thing I placed in my bag. Not in its little bottle, but poured into a double-knotted plastic bag, the kind my mother used for market vegetables. Gritty reality, not sentiment. The photograph of her, young and fierce on that foreign shore, went between the pages of my passport. A pressed flower of memory. The little wooden boat I kept in my pocket, its hull smooth from my worrying thumb. The key to locker 114 was on a cord around my neck, hidden under my shirt, its brass teeth biting a cold impression into my skin.

I was not packing to leave Penang. I was packing to arrive somewhere else. The distinction was everything.

A soft knock, two taps then one, fractured the silence. It was not Uncle Hock’s imperious pound. The door opened a slit and Ah Ling’s face appeared, pale in the gloom. Her eyes, usually downcast, were wide and bright with a terror that had tipped over into resolve.

“He is on the telephone in the study,” she whispered, her voice a thread of sound. “Arguing with the columbarium manager. He says you are… difficult. That they must be ready.”

“Thank you, Ah Ling.”

She slipped inside, closing the door without a sound. In her hands was a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. “Your mother left this with me. The last time she was here. She said, ‘Keep this for my girl. For when she is ready to swim upstream.’” Ah Ling’s lips trembled. “I did not understand. I think now I do.”

I took the bundle. The cloth was faded batik, blue waves on a cream sea. Unfolding it, I found a stack of Malaysian ringgit, worn and soft, and a single, folded sheet of airmail paper. My mother’s handwriting, a frantic, sloping script, bled through the thin page.

*My girl,*

*If you are reading this, the current has taken you where I could not go. The map is only paper. The true path is written in the salt on your skin, the ache in your feet. Do not let them bury me in the dark. I have seen enough dark.*

*The key is the start. The sand is the middle. The water is the end.*

*Remember the lightning.*

*Swim.*

No signature. Just a watermark of what might have been a tear, or a drop of coffee, blurring the word *lightning*.

Ah Ling was watching me, her hands knotted together. “She was crying when she gave it to me. But she was also laughing. Like she had won a game no one else was playing.”

“You risk a lot,” I said, folding the note away with the money. “He will be angry.”

“He has been angry since the day she left,” Ah Ling said, a simple statement of fact. “I loved her too. She saw me. Not the maid. *Me.*” She nodded to the bag. “You go. I will make distraction. Tell him you are weeping in your room, that you will obey. It will give you hours.”

This was the alliance, then. Forged not in blood, but in the quiet recognition she had given my mother, and now, silently, gave to me. I reached out, touched her arm. Her skin was cool, her bones bird-like under my fingers. She flinched, not from me, but from the unfamiliarity of the contact. Then she covered my hand with hers, a quick, hard press.

“Go out the kitchen. Through the alley. The bus to the airport leaves from Lebuh Chulia in one hour.”

She left as silently as she had come. The shadow under the door disappeared. I was alone again, but the silence was different now. It had an accomplice.

I finished packing. One backpack. The urn in a canvas tote, padded with my sweater. I looked at the pile of torn map on the floor. The shape of Penang was in three pieces. I left them there. A broken thing for a broken man.

The kitchen was a cave of lingering heat and the smell of yesterday’s curry. I slipped out the back door into the narrow service alley, a world of cracked tiles, dripping air-conditioner units, and the sweet-rot smell of discarded *jambu*. The humid air closed around me like a fist. I walked quickly, head down, not running, just a woman with a bag. At the end of the alley, the chaos of Georgetown swallowed me whole.

***

The bus to the airport was a shuddering metal box, smelling of hot vinyl and exhausted hope. I took a window seat, the urn strapped in beside me once more. This time, it did not feel ridiculous. It felt like a companion in crime. The city unspooled outside the glass—the shophouses with their peeling paint, the glossy new cafes, the monsoon drains choked with plastic. It was a palimpsest, my mother’s memories bleeding through the modern text. *Here is where I bought my first *cheongsam*. *There is where your grandfather shouted at me for looking at a boy.* The map was in my head now. Indelible.

The airport was a temple of transience, its air-conditioned breath a shock after the soup of the street. I bought a one-way ticket to Sydney with my mother’s money. The transaction was clinical. The clerk’s fingers, clean and manicured, tapped the keyboard. His eyes passed over me, over the canvas tote, registering nothing. Another ghost in the machine. I was grateful, again.

But as I turned from the counter, boarding pass in hand, I saw him.

It was not Uncle Hock. It was my cousin, Jian. He stood by a pillar near the entrance to security, his arms crossed, his face a mask of conflicted duty. He was younger than me, with our grandfather’s stubborn jaw. He wore a cheap polo shirt and a look of profound discomfort. Our eyes met across the flowing river of passengers. He didn’t move to stop me. He just nodded, once, a sharp downward cut of his chin. Then he turned and walked away, melting into the crowd.

A sentry. A witness. Letting me pass, or marking my passage for the family record? I would never know. The fracture was not clean. It had splinters, and some of them were still embedded in the heartwood of the family, causing quiet, persistent pain.

The flight was a long, numb crossing. I drank bad coffee and watched the map on the screen, a cheerful cartoon plane inching over the vast, blank blue of the ocean. I slept fitfully, dreaming of torn paper reforming into waves. The urn sat on the empty seat beside me. Once, during turbulence, the seatbelt tightened across its middle, and I had to look away.

We descended into a Sydney morning, sharp and bright and alien. The light had a different quality, a bleaching, honest clarity that felt like an accusation. It stripped away the soft, green haze of Penang, left everything exposed. I moved through customs in a daze, my mother’s ashes declared on a form, a bureaucratic checkbox for grief. The official, a woman with kind eyes and efficient hands, stamped my passport without comment. Another transaction.

Outside, the air was cool, smelling of jet fuel and eucalyptus. I took a train into the city, the landscape a jarring montage of red-roofed suburbs, skeletal gum trees, and the sudden, shocking glitter of the harbour. It was my mother’s postcard come to life, but without the softening filter of time. It was just a place. A beautiful, foreign place.

My backpack felt heavier. The key around my neck felt like an anchor. This was the location of the ordeal. Not a fortress of stone, but a fortress of the unfamiliar. The heart of darkness was the gaping unknown of her life here.

Central Station was a cathedral of noise and echoing footsteps. I found the bank of lockers, a wall of identical green doors, each with a numbered keyhole. They were anachronisms, relics of a time before cloud storage and digital ghosts. Locker 114 was at chest height, in the middle of a row. The brass key was warm from my skin. It slid in with a smooth, oiled click. The door opened with a metallic sigh.

Inside was not a treasure chest. It was a time capsule, and time had done its work. There was a smell of old paper and damp. A leather satchel, cracked along the folds. I lifted it out, heavy with its own silence.

I took it to a plastic chair in a quiet corner of the station, near a shuttered newsstand. The urn I placed between my feet, a ceramic touchstone. My hands were not shaking now. They were steady, cold. I unbuckled the satchel.

On top was a manila envelope. Inside, a Australian passport in the name of *Chua Mei Lin*. Her face looked back at me, younger than in the Bondi photo, her expression solemn for the camera, but with a hint of a challenge in her eyes. Under it, a residency permit, a tax file number, a membership card for a library in Surry Hills. The documents of a life built.

Beneath that, a journal. A simple, cloth-bound notebook. The first page was dated the year she left. The writing was not the frantic script of the airmail note. It was careful, deliberate, as if she was trying to press order onto chaos.

*Today I rented a room. It has a window that looks onto a brick wall. The sunlight hits it for ten minutes in the afternoon. It is the most beautiful thing I have ever owned.*

*I got a job. Washing dishes in a restaurant on Crown Street. My hands are raw. The chef calls me “Mary.” I do not correct him. Mary has no history. Mary can start again.*

*I walked to the ocean today. It is too big. It does not care about my sorrow. This is a relief.*

I read, and the station faded. The announcements, the rumble of trains, the flow of people—it all became a distant river. I was in her silence, in her ten minutes of sunlight. I read about her loneliness, which was vast and quiet. About her small triumphs—a better room, a job in a flower market, a friend named Margot who smoked rollies and taught her to say “no worries.” I read about her fear, a constant, low hum. Fear of the family finding her. Fear of failing. Fear of this new, spacious life that felt, some days, like a beautifully furnished prison.

And I read about me.

*The letter from Hock came. He says the girl is walking. He sent a photograph. She has my eyes, but his stubborn mouth. This is a good combination. She will need both.*

*I dreamt of her last night. She was calling for me, but I was on the other side of a pane of glass. I could see her, but she saw only her own reflection.*

*Today I bought a postcard of Bondi Beach. I will send it to her for her birthday. What do I write? “Wish you were here”? It is a cruel joke. But I want her to know this exists. That a world this bright exists.*

The entries became less frequent. The handwriting sometimes slurred, tired. Then, near the end:

*The doctor says it is in my lungs. He uses words like “aggressive” and “options.” I think of the dark, quiet house in Penang. I think of a numbered niche. And I think, no. Not that dark. Not that quiet.*

*I have bought the urn. Celadon. The colour of a distant sea. I have written the instructions. The key, the sand, the water. It is a trail of breadcrumbs, but not back to the house. Forward. Into the bright.*

*My girl, if you find this, do not mourn the mother who left. Mourn, if you must, the woman who stayed. She is the one who is truly lost.*

The last entry was a single line, the writing frail, spider-like:

*The lightning remembers where it has been. Follow the scar.*

I closed the journal. My face was dry. My chest was a hollowed-out bell, reverberating with a silent, deafening note. She had not been a phantom of joy and rebellion. She had been a woman, terribly alone, building a life from scraps of sunlight and fear, thinking of me with every brick she laid.

The satchel held one more thing. A small, flat box. Inside, on a bed of faded velvet, lay a pair of earrings. Simple silver studs, shaped like tiny, imperfect stars. A note tucked beside them: *For your graduation. I saw them and thought of you, looking up.*

I had never graduated. The family had considered it unnecessary.

I took the earrings out. I removed the simple studs I wore and put my mother’s stars into my ears. They felt cool, a slight, new weight. An inheritance.

The team was just me. And her. And the ghosts she had left here. Our resources were depleted—the money was almost gone, my energy was a frayed wire, my trust in family was ashes. But our unity was absolute. It had been tested by silence, by distance, by a torn map, and had hardened into something unbreakable: understanding.

I repacked the satchel, slung it over my shoulder, picked up the urn. The moment of quiet was over. The storm was not in a confrontation with a person. It was in the next step. The sand was the middle. The water was the end.

I took a train to Bondi. It was time to face the ocean that was too big, that did not care.

***

The beach was a shock of sound and light and movement. It was a living entity, pulsing with a raw, athletic joy that felt worlds away from the quiet, green grief of Penang. The sand was pale gold, hot underfoot. The air smelled of salt, sunscreen, and frying food. Bodies, pink and brown and golden, lay like seals on towels. The surf roared, a constant, white noise of power.

I stood at the edge where the sand turned hard and wet, my shoes in my hand, the urn in the tote over my shoulder. The water rushed in, foaming around my ankles, shockingly cold. It tugged at me, the suck of the retreating wave a physical invitation, a threat.

I walked south, away from the crowds, past the painted surf club, towards the rocky headland at the end of the crescent. The noise faded. Here, the cliffs rose, stained with mineral runoff, and the waves crashed against black rocks in great, explosive geysers of white. It was more desolate, more fitting.

I found a flat rock, out of the reach of the spray, and sat. I took out the urn. I took out the bag of Bondi sand. I held them both, one in each hand, the ceramic cool, the plastic warm from the sun.

This was the external defense. Not a guardian, but the sheer, overwhelming *presence* of her choice. This vast, indifferent beauty. This was what she had chosen over me. For the first time, staring at the endless blue horizon, I felt not betrayal, but the staggering scale of her despair. To choose this, she must have been drowning in that dark, quiet house. This was not an escape *from*. It was a gasp *towards*.

I opened the bag of sand. I opened the urn.

The ashes were not like in the movies. They were not a fine, uniform grey. They were granular, mixed with small, white fragments of bone. Gritty. Real. I mixed the Bondi sand with them, the golden grains with the grey, the past with the present, the there with the here. It felt like the most intimate thing I had ever done.

A shadow fell across my hands. I looked up, shielding my eyes against the sun.

A woman stood a few feet away. She was perhaps sixty, with wild, grey hair tied in a messy bun, wearing a faded sundress and a leather jacket. Her face was deeply lined, tanned to the texture of old saddle. She held a cigarette, unlit, between her fingers.

“You’re Mei’s girl,” she said. Her voice was raspy, Australian, but with a musical lilt that hinted at somewhere else. “Aren’t you.”

It wasn’t a question. I stared, my throat locked.

“Saw you with the urn. Recognized the shape. She described it.” The woman came closer, her eyes on my face. They were a pale, watery blue, and they saw everything. “She said you had her eyes. She was right. I’m Margot.”

The friend from the journal. The one who smoked rollies. She was not a ghost. She was flesh, and she was here.

“How…” I managed.

“I come here most days. To the rocks. She loved this spot. Said it felt like the edge of the world.” Margot sat down on the rock beside me, not too close, giving me space. She looked at the urn, at the mingled sands in my hands. A slow smile touched her lips. “Good for you. She wanted this. Not that bloody closet in the wall.”

“You knew?”
“She talked about it. Near the end. ‘Margot,’ she said, ‘if my girl ever comes, you’ll know. She’ll look lost and found all at once.’” Margot lit her cigarette, cupping her hand against the sea breeze. “You do.”

The fear, the loneliness, the resolve—it all surged up, threatening to spill over. Here was a keeper of memories I had no access to. A guardian of a life I’d only just begun to read.

“Was she happy?” The question was out before I could stop it, pathetic and childish.

Margot took a long drag, exhaling towards the sea. “Happy? That’s a big word. She was *alive*. Some days, vibrantly so. She loved the market, the flowers, the light. She’d dance in her kitchen to the radio. Other days… the shadows got her. The guilt. The missing.” She looked at me. “You were the biggest shadow, love. And the biggest light. She never stopped carrying you. It just… bent her spine, after a while.”

I looked down at the ashes and sand in my hands. The ultimate depletion. The final test of unity—between me and the mother I was finally meeting, between my memory of her and her reality.

“She wanted you to know it was a choice, not an abandonment,” Margot said softly. “A terrible choice. The kind that leaves a scar. But her only one.” She stood up, grinding the cigarette butt under her heel. “I’ll leave you to it. It’s your journey now.” She began to walk away, then paused. “She left something else for you. At my place. A box. Said it was the last piece. If you want it, I’m in the book. Margot Pryce. Surry Hills.”

She walked off, back towards the bustling beach, a solitary, leather-clad figure against the riot of colour.

I was alone again with the ocean’s roar. The bond was deepened, not by comfort, but by brutal, shared truth. The team—me, her, Margot, Ah Ling, even conflicted Jian—was a network of scars, a circuit of memory finally connecting.

I stood, the urn in my hands. I walked to the very edge, where the rock met the surging foam. The water was deep here, a churning, emerald green.

“The water is the end,” I whispered.

I tipped the urn. The ashes and the mingled sand streamed out, a grey and gold plume caught by the wind. For a moment, it hung in the air, a ghost against the blue. Then it settled onto the surface of the water, floating for a heartbeat before the waves, indifferent and eternal, pulled it under.

It was not an ending. It was a release. A returning. She was in the bright, vast thing now. Not in the dark.

The urn was empty. I held the cold, celadon ceramic. A vessel that had completed its purpose. I did not keep it. I turned and, with a strength that came from somewhere beyond me, hurled it out into the deep water. It spun, a pale green wheel against the sky, and vanished with a small, insignificant splash.

It was done.

I felt light. Hollowed out, but clean. The key around my neck, the star earrings in my ears, the journal in the satchel—these were the relics now. The map was gone. The ashes were gone. All that was left was the memory, and the path ahead.

I walked back along the sand, towards the world. The sun was lower, painting the sky in streaks of orange and violet. A lightning bolt of colour over the sea. *Follow the scar.*

I would call Margot. I would get the last box. But as I reached the pavement, my phone, silent for days, buzzed in my pocket. A single, unfamiliar number. A Malaysian country code.

A text message. No words.

Just a photograph.

It was a picture of my grandmother’s *jade bangle*, the one she always wore, the one that was supposed to be buried with her. It was resting on a familiar, faded batik cloth—the same blue waves on cream sea that had wrapped my mother’s money.

The photograph was taken in a room I knew. The kitchen of the house in Penang.

And curled around the bangle was a woman’s hand. On the wrist, a long, thin, white scar.

Ah Ling’s hand.

The message below the image flashed once, then disappeared, as if deleted remotely.

*She is not the only one who knows how to swim upstream. Come home.*

## **Chapter 6**

The photograph was a hook in my gut. A sharp, physical yank back across the South China Sea. I stood on the pavement, the taste of salt and ashes still on my lips, the world gone soft and painterly in the dusk, and felt the old geography of fear reassert itself. The green smear of the peninsula, the humid dark of that kitchen. *Come home.* It wasn’t an invitation. It was a summons from a grave I’d thought was sealed.

I called the number. It rang into a void, a hollow, digital silence that ate the sound. No answer. No voicemail. Just the void. I texted back: *Who is this?* The message failed to deliver, a red exclamation point in a grey bubble. The number was a ghost. Only the image remained, seared onto my screen: the jade bangle, the batik, the scar. Proof. A violation. Ah Ling was in the house. She had the bangle. She knew about the batik. The transaction was not complete.

Margot’s voice, when I finally reached her in London, was a thin wire of static and concern. “The box is here. It’s… smaller than I thought. Just a tin, really. Sealed with tape that’s gone brittle.” She paused. “You sound different. Are you all right?”

“No,” I said. The word was clean, like a stone. “I’m not. Send it to the old address. In Penang.”

“Are you sure? After everything…”

“It’s the only address I have left.”

I booked the next flight. The journey was a reverse echo, a rewinding of the tape. Airport fluorescents instead of train compartment gloom, the smell of antiseptic and anxiety instead of diesel and squid. But the feeling was the same: a suspension, a breath held. The urn was gone, but I carried its hollow shape inside me. The key was a cold weight against my chest. The journal in my satchel was the only map I had left, and it led to a place I’d already fled.

This time, I took a taxi from the airport in Penang. The driver was a young man with earbuds in, tapping his steering wheel to a silent rhythm. He didn’t look at me in the mirror. The world outside was a familiar blur of neon and monsoon-stained concrete, the lush decay of the island pushing in at the edges. The house in the quiet lane near the water looked smaller. It had shrunk in my absence, hunched under the weight of the rain trees. The gate squealed the same protest.

The air in the garden was a solid thing, hot and damp, smelling of frangipani and wet earth. The front door was unlocked.

She was in the kitchen, as I knew she would be. Sitting at the old marble-topped table, a cup of untouched tea cooling before her. Ah Ling. But not the Ah Ling of my memory—the sharp, efficient silhouette in the doorway, the dismissive flick of a cloth. This woman was thinner, the bones of her wrists pressing against her skin like river stones. Her hair, still pulled back, was more grey than black. But her eyes were the same: flat, dark pools that gave nothing back.

On the table between us, resting on the familiar cream-and-blue batik, was my grandmother’s jade bangle.

“You came,” she said. Her voice was dry, like leaves skittering on stone.

“You took it from her,” I said. My own voice sounded strange in the enclosed space. The kitchen was a museum of my childhood. The same blue tiles, the same crack in the ceiling shaped like Siam. The same lingering scent of ginger and mildew. “You took it before they closed the coffin.”

“It was not for them to have.” She didn’t touch the bangle. Her scarred hand lay beside it, a pale, twisted root. “It was never for them.”

“It was hers.”

“It is a key,” she said, simply. “Not a jewel.”

I took the chair opposite her. The marble was cool through my clothes. “The text. The photograph. What do you want?”

For the first time, her gaze shifted from a point somewhere beyond my shoulder and settled on my face. It was like being measured by a caliper. “You scattered the ashes. In the sea.”

It wasn’t a question. A cold thread pulled tight in my chest. “How do you know that?”

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched her lips. It held no warmth. “The wind knows. The water knows. You think you performed a secret. A private thing. But a returning is never private.” She nodded at the bangle. “You have the other key. The one from the safe deposit box. The one she left for you.”

My hand went to the key beneath my shirt. She tracked the movement.

“You know the story,” she said. “The one she told you. The girl who swam upstream. Who became a dragon.” She picked up her teacup, looked at the leaves, set it down again without drinking. “It is not the whole story. Your mother, she loved the poetry of it. The transformation. She did not love the teeth. Or the mud.”

“What are you talking about?”

“The girl did not swim alone.” Ah Ling’s finger traced the edge of the batik cloth. “She had a sister. The sister held her foot as she fought the current. The sister pushed her over the last waterfall. The sister stayed behind, in the muddy village, and watched her fly away.” She looked up. “Your mother was the dragon. I was the sister who stayed in the mud.”

The words hung in the thick air. I felt the world tilt, the careful story of my mother’s life—her escape, her reinvention, her lonely brilliance—crack along a fault line I never knew was there.

“You’re lying.”

“Am I?” She pushed the bandle towards me, an inch. “Why do you think I was here? In this house, with her mother, all those years? For wages? She sent money. She sent instructions. *Take care of her. Do not let her forget me.* I was the keeper of the shrine. The one who stayed behind.” Her flat eyes glinted. “And the one who knows where the bones are buried. Not her ashes. The real bones. The things she did not want you, or anyone, to find.”

“My mother didn’t—”

“Your mother was a woman,” Ah Ling cut in, her voice sharpening to a blade. “Not a saint. She made choices. Hard choices. To get what she wanted. To become what she became. This…” She gestured around the kitchen, at the house, at the whole of Penang. “This was the price. And I was part of the payment.”

I felt the hollow inside me grow, a cavern echoing with new, terrible possibilities. “What choices?”

“The last box,” she said, ignoring my question. “The one coming from London. It is not for you. It is the final piece. The proof.”

“Proof of what?”

“Of where the money came from.” She said it quietly, as if stating the time. “The real money. Not the salary from the university. The money that bought the flat in London, the education, the silence. The money that was wrapped in this batik.”

The room seemed to pulse. The crack in the ceiling looked like a river now, a delta, a branching scar. “She was a professor. A linguist.”

“She was many things.” Ah Ling leaned forward, and for a moment, the mask of impassivity slipped. I saw a lifetime of contained fury, of swallowed words, of being the hand that pushed while another flew. “She worked for them. When she was young. Before you. When her mind for languages was a tool, not a art. She translated. She listened. She… facilitated. For people who pay very well for such things.”

“No.” The denial was automatic, brittle. But the memory surfaced, unbidden: my mother, fluent in five languages, her ear attuned to the slightest shift in dialect, her ability to disappear into any accent. A party trick, she’d called it. *A parlor game.*

“The company she kept in those days,” Ah Ling continued, relentless. “The men who came to the old apartment. The late-night calls. She thought it was a game, too. At first. Then it was a debt. Then it was a life.” She tapped the bangle with one fingernail. *Tink.* “This was given to her by one of them. A guarantee. A promise of protection. She gave it to her mother to hide. She tried to get out. She used what she knew, what she had, to buy her way into a new life. A clean life. With you.”

The foundation of my life was sand, shifting, pulling me under. “Why are you telling me this?”

“Because they are not done.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Because she kept a record. A journal. Not the one of poems and maps. A real one. Names. Dates. Transactions. She kept it as insurance. She sent it away, to the lawyer in London, with instructions to give it to you only if she died… unnaturally. She thought it would protect you. It is a poison. It is the thing they will kill for.”

The journal in my satchel seemed to burn against my side. *Her other journal.*
“The box from Margot…”

“Is the journal. And the key,” she nodded at the bangle, “opens the place where the money from the last transaction was kept. A transaction she never completed. Their money. They want it back. Or they want the journal destroyed. They have been looking for both since she died.”

“Who are ‘they’?”

The question seemed to almost amuse her. “You do not need a name. You need to understand the water you are in. They knew she was sick. They waited. When she died, they began to look. They have been watching the house. They have been watching me. They have been watching you.” She looked at my phone on the table. “The photograph was a warning. To me. To show me they could reach into this house, my life, anytime. They sent it to you to draw you here. To draw the box here. They do not want to chase it across the world. They want everything in one place. A tidy ending.”

I felt the trap then, the walls of the familiar kitchen closing in. The summoning. *Come home.* “So this is a trap. And you’re helping them.”

“I am surviving,” she hissed, the fury flashing again. “I have survived in the mud for forty years. Holding her secrets. Wiping her mother’s chin. Waiting. I am tired.” She drew a slow breath, composing herself back into stone. “They have my nephew. In Singapore. He is a good boy. An engineer. They have him.”

The devastation was absolute. It wasn’t a confrontation; it was a dismantling. Every truth I held, every memory, was stripped and shown to be a facsimile. My mother was not who I thought. My quest was not my own. I was a pawn on a board set up decades before I was born. The victory on the beach—the release, the lightness—was a childish fantasy. The ashes were gone, but the past was not. It was here, in this room, wearing the face of a woman I never knew, holding a jade bangle that was a key to a lock I didn’t want to open.

I had suffered a defeat more total than any physical loss. The mother I had mourned, the identity I had built as her daughter, her keeper, her final witness—it died in that chair. It turned to ash in my mouth. I was nobody’s daughter. I was the heir to a debt and a danger I did not understand.

I stood up, the chair legs scraping on the tile like a scream. “Then give them what they want. Give them the bangle. Tell them the box is coming. Let me go.”

“It is not so simple.” She rose too, facing me across the table. For the first time, I saw not a servant, not a keeper, but a woman of formidable, weathered will. “They will take everything. And then they will erase the loose ends. You. Me. My nephew. They are not bankers. They are cleaners.” She picked up the jade bangle. It looked heavy in her hand. “There is only one way out. We must give them what they want, but not in the way they expect. We must use the keys. We must take their money, and we must use it to buy our way out.”

“*We?*” The word was a laugh, choked and bitter. “You sold me to them.”

“I brought you to the battlefield,” she corrected, coldly. “There is a difference. You can die here, in this house, when they come for the box. Or you can fight. Your mother’s blood is in you. Not just the poetry. The teeth. The mud. Do you have it? Or did she wash it all away in that London rain?”

I looked at her scarred hand, the sister’s hand that had pushed the dragon into the sky. I thought of my mother’s voice on the tapes, telling her beautiful, incomplete stories. I thought of the hollow feeling inside me, the clean hollow after the ashes were gone. It was not empty. It was waiting to be filled with something new. Something harder.

The sacrifice was not of an object, but of a self. The daughter who believed in the dragon story had to die here, at this table. What was left would have to be something else.

“What is the plan?” My voice was not my own. It was lower. Flatter. A transaction.

A flicker of something—respect?—passed through her eyes. “The money from the last deal. It is here. In Penang. In a private vault. The bangle is the identifier. The key you wear is the physical key. The vault is in the old Standard Chartered building on Beach Street. We go together. We retrieve it. It is a significant sum. Enough to buy three new lives, far away. We meet them with the money and the journal. We trade for my nephew’s safety, and our passage out.”

“They’ll just take it and kill us anyway.”

“Not,” she said, “if the journal is already somewhere else. In the hands of someone who will release it if we disappear. An insurance policy. Your lawyer friend in London. She must be ready.”

It was a desperate, ugly plan. Born of mud and survival. It had the cold, sharp taste of truth my mother’s stories had lacked.

“Why should I trust you?”

“You should not,” she said, handing me the jade bangle. It was cool, impossibly smooth. “You should trust that I want my nephew to live. And that I am tired of being the one left in the mud. This time, I swim too.”

I closed my fingers around the jade. It felt like a bone. A truth. I nodded.

We left the house as the tropical dark fell, a sudden, velvet blanket. We took her old Proton car, the engine coughing like a consumptive. The streets of George Town were a carnival of shadows and light, the heritage shophouses glowing like lanterns, hiding their own secrets in their deep, narrow backs.

The old Standard Chartered building was a colonial ghost, a hulk of white plaster and columns at the edge of the financial district. At this hour, it was deserted. The private vault service operated in the basement, accessible by a separate, unmarked door down a side alley. Ah Ling knew the code for the outer gate—a number she recited without looking, a number I knew was my mother’s birthday.

The room inside was cold, air-conditioned to a tomb-like chill. A single, polite Malay man in a too-large blazer sat behind a bulletproof glass partition. He looked bored. Ah Ling placed the jade bangle on the counter. I added the key from my neck. He glanced at them, then at a ledger—an actual, physical book—on his desk. He made no comment. No curiosity. Just the transaction.

He led us through a heavy door, into a room lined with safe deposit boxes of varying sizes. Ours was a large one, at knee height. He inserted a master key, nodded for me to insert mine. The lock turned with a solid, satisfying *clunk*.

He left us alone with the open box.

Inside was no stack of cash. It was a single, sealed, waterproof bag. Inside the bag were three things: a stack of bearer bonds, thick and crisp; a Swiss bank passbook; and a small, unmarked black notebook.

Ah Ling let out a long, slow breath. “The money,” she said, pointing to the bonds and passbook. She reached for the black notebook.

I picked it up first. It was the same size, the same feel, as my journal of maps. This was its dark twin. I opened it. My mother’s handwriting, but tighter, faster, without the flourishes. Lists of initials. Numbers. Dates going back thirty years. Fragments of conversation in multiple languages. It was a ledger of ghosts.

This was the hidden strength. Not a newfound courage, but a cold inheritance. The truth, however ugly, was a weapon. The insight was this: I was not just my mother’s daughter. I was her accomplice. Her heir. The keeper of her real history. The strength came from accepting the whole woman—the poet and the pragmatist, the dragon and the deal-maker. The sacrifice of my innocent memory was the price of this power.

“We take it all,” I said, my voice echoing slightly in the cold room. “We photograph every page of this. You send the photographs to Margot, now. The originals, we keep with us. For the trade.”

Ah Ling didn’t argue. She took out a cheap smartphone, and under the sterile fluorescent light, I turned the pages while she captured each one. The click of the digital shutter was the sound of a ghost being pinned in place. Our insurance.

We placed the bonds, the passbook, and the notebook back into the waterproof bag. I slung it into my satchel, next to the journal of maps. The weight was immense. The weight of a life. Of three lives.

We drove back towards the house in a silence that was no longer empty, but charged with a grim purpose. We had the object of the quest. Not the one I had set out for, but the one that had been waiting for me all along. We had a currency to buy our freedom. We had transformed from prey into precarious dealers.

As we turned into the quiet lane, we saw the lights were on in the house. Every single one. Blazing against the night.

We had not left them on.

Ah Ling stopped the car a hundred yards away, killed the engine. We sat in the dark, listening to the cicadas scream.

“They are here,” she whispered. The fear was back in her voice, the iron control fraying. “They are waiting.”

I looked at the house, a bright cube of danger in the fragrant dark. I felt the bag in my satchel. I touched the key, now cold again against my skin. The ordeal was not over. It was here.

“Then we don’t go in,” I said, the new voice steady. “We call. We set the trade. A public place. Daylight.”

She looked at me, and in the dim dashboard glow, I saw the sister from the story, the one from the mud, and I saw the faint, desperate hope that she might not have to stay there forever.

My phone buzzed. Not the ghost number this time. It was Margot.

The message was brief: *Photos received. Understood. Be careful.*

And then a second message, from her: *A man came to the office today. Asking about you. About a box. He was polite. He knew my name.*

He had left a card, she said. She’d photographed it.

The image came through. A plain, cream-colored business card. No company name. Just a phone number with a Malaysian country code.

And a name, embossed in simple black type.

**Tan Hock Seng.**

The name meant nothing to me. But I heard the sharp intake of breath from Ah Ling. Her face, in the shadows, had turned the color of ash.

“You know him,” I said.

She nodded once, a stiff, brittle movement. “He was your mother’s first liaison. Her… handler.” She closed her eyes. “He is not a cleaner. He is the owner of the house. And he does not make trades.”

She looked from the glowing phone screen to the bright, waiting house.

“He comes to collect what is his.”

# Chapter 7

## **Chapter 7**

The cicadas were a single, taut wire of sound. Inside the car, the silence was a different texture—thick, granular, like the air before a monsoon breaks. The house sat at the end of the lane, a lit diorama. Every window bled yellow light onto the frangipani trees, turning their blossoms into pale, watchful faces. It was an obscene display of occupancy. A claim.

Ah Ling’s breath was shallow beside me. The name on the card—Tan Hock Seng—hung between us, a spell that had turned our precarious victory to dust.

“The owner of the house,” I repeated, the words tasting of cold iron.

“She never told you,” Ah Ling whispered, not looking at me. Her gaze was fixed on the bright windows. “She would not have. It was the first rule. You do not name the landlord. You pay the rent, you keep the walls clean, and you pretend the ground beneath you is yours.” A bitter, hollow sound escaped her. It was not a laugh. “She paid her rent for twenty years. With information. With small, careful services. This house was her retainer. And the box… the box was the final installment. The one that would pay off the lease forever.”

I understood then. My mother hadn’t been hiding the box from some vague, faceless threat. She had been hiding it from her landlord. From the man who held the deed to her borrowed safety. The ultimate debt collector.

I looked down at the phone. Margot’s last message glowed: *He was polite. He knew my name.* Politeness was the most terrifying currency. It meant no rush, no bluster. It meant the outcome was never in doubt.

“If he doesn’t make trades,” I said, my new voice lower, “what does he do?”

Ah Ling finally turned her head. The dashboard lights hollowed her cheeks, made her eyes into dark pools. “He assesses value. And then he takes it. He is a… curator. Of people, of secrets. He acquired your mother. And now you are part of the collection.”

The green ceramic urn in my memory seemed to vibrate with a silent, furious hum. *Like a tourist*, she’d have sniffed. But this was her legacy. Not a home, but a tenancy. Not freedom, but a transfer of ownership.

I made the decision with a clarity that felt surgical. “We don’t go in. We don’t call. We leave. Right now.”

“He will find us.”
“He’ll find us faster if we walk into that parlor.”
“Where?” The word was a plea.

I thought of the key, cold against my skin. The only thing I had that wasn’t part of her ledger. “Somewhere he doesn’t own.”

I reached for the ignition, but Ah Ling’s hand, cold and surprisingly strong, closed over my wrist. “Wait.” She was staring past me, out my window, into the deep shadow of the hedge that lined the lane. “Did you see?”

I followed her look. Nothing. Just the oscillation of leaves in the slight breeze. The frantic, endless scream of the insects.
“What?”
“A light. A cigarette.”

We sat, frozen, watching the darkness. A minute passed. Then, from the blackness, a pinpoint of orange glowed, brightened, faded. Someone was standing there, thirty feet away, leaning against the gatepost of the neighboring empty lot. Waiting. Not hiding. Just… maintaining the perimeter.

They had seen us the moment we turned into the lane.

The transaction of fear was complete. We were the product, and the invoice had been sighted.

“Drive,” Ah Ling said, her voice flat. “Slowly. Past the house. Do not stop.”

I started the car. The engine was too loud. I pulled forward, the wheels crunching on the gravel. As we passed the house, I forced myself to look. The front door was open. The screen door was a dark mesh. In the bright rectangle of the living room, a man stood. He was not looking out. He was examining a small figurine on my mother’s shelf—the porcelain dancer she’d bought in Penang. He held it delicately in his palm. He was medium height, dressed in a light linen shirt. He turned the figurine over, studying its base. His movements were economical, absorbed. A man appraising a piece of his own inventory.

He did not glance toward the car. He didn’t need to.

We drove to the end of the lane, turned onto the main road. My hands were slick on the wheel. The rearview mirror showed only empty, dark road. No one followed.

“He wanted us to see him,” I said.
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“To make us understand the geometry. We are inside the problem now. There is no outside.”

We drove in silence for an hour, aimlessly, the tension a third passenger in the car. Finally, on the outskirts of George Town, I pulled into the lot of a *kopitiam* that was still open, a fluorescent oasis in the sleeping streets. The smell of stale coffee and floor detergent was a vulgar comfort.

Over thick, sweet *teh tarik* that we didn’t drink, I opened my satchel. I took out the cloth-wrapped bundle. The reward. The thing we had bled for.

Ah Ling watched, her eyes wary, as I unfolded the fabric.

It was a book. Not a ledger, not a journal. A novel. A old, cheap pulp edition of *The Great Gatsby*, its cover sun-bleached and soft at the edges. The currency of our freedom was a second-hand paperback.

I opened it. The pages were brittle. And there, in the narrow margin of page seventy-four, was my mother’s handwriting. Not the elegant script of her official forms, but a hurried, compressed pencil scrawl. A single sentence.

*For the girl in the rain. Find her.*

Beneath it, tucked into the gutter of the binding, was a photograph. I slid it out.

A black-and-white snapshot, curling at the edges. Two young women, arms linked, squinting into the sun. They stood on a muddy riverbank, tin-roofed shacks behind them. One was my mother, her face heartbreakingly young, fierce, her hair cut short like a boy’s. The other was a stranger, softer-faced, smiling shyly, a faded *sarong* tied around her waist. On the back, in the same pencil: *Me & Li Hua, Sungai Lembing, 1979.*

I pushed the photo across the sticky table to Ah Ling. She picked it up, her fingers trembling. She stared at the shy, smiling girl. A sound escaped her, a soft, broken exhalation. She touched the face in the photograph.

“My aunt,” she said, the words barely audible. “My mother’s younger sister. She went to the city. She never came back. We heard she… found trouble. We never knew.”

“The girl in the rain,” I said.

Ah Ling nodded, tears cutting clean tracks through the dust on her cheeks. “My mother spoke of her. Only once, when she was very sick. She said Li Hua was caught in a rainstorm on her way home from the market. That a woman gave her shelter. A clever woman from the city. She said that woman stole her future.” She looked from the photo to me. “Your mother.”

The pieces locked together with a cold, physical click. My mother’s first acquisition. Not a secret, but a person. A life plucked from a riverbank and folded into her own design. Li Hua. The first link in the chain that would become Ah Ling’s family debt. This was the original sin. And my mother, in her final calculus, had left the means for its redress. Not money. A name. A face. A thread of truth.

It was not absolution. It was a correction in the ledger.

“This is yours,” I said, sliding the book and the photograph toward her. “This is what she owed.”

Ah Ling clutched the picture to her chest, her shoulders shaking. It was not a celebration. It was a quiet, seismic rupture. The story she had been fed—of a predatory stranger—was true, but incomplete. The villain had, at the last, offered a fragment of a map. It changed nothing of the past. It changed everything about the ground beneath her feet.

For a long time, she cried. I sat and watched the geckos on the *kopitiam* wall, frozen in their own patient hunt. This was the reward. Not power, but knowledge. Not reconciliation, but the terrible, specific weight of truth. It was heavier than any jade.

When her tears subsided, she carefully wrapped the book and photo back in the cloth. She placed it in her own bag with a ritual solemnity. She looked at me, her eyes raw but clear.

“What will you do?” she asked.

I thought of Tan Hock Seng, turning the porcelain dancer in his well-kept hand. I was part of the collection now. A curious piece, newly acquired. He would come to catalogue me.

“I have to go back,” I said. The words surprised me with their certainty.
“Back? To the house?”
“To my old world.” I meant Kuala Lumpur. I meant Margot’s office, my apartment with its rented furniture, the life that was a waiting room. “He went to Margot. He’s polite. He’s establishing the connection. Making it personal. If I run, he’ll simply collect from everyone I’ve ever touched. Starting with her.” I saw Margot’s neat desk, her kind, worried face. A new line item in Tan Hock Seng’s ledger. “I have to make this victory mean something. I have to turn this from a collection into a conversation.”

“You cannot have a conversation with a curator. You are the exhibit.”
“Then I’ll change the exhibit,” I said. I touched the key beneath my shirt. The one thing he didn’t know about. The one piece not on his inventory. “I need to know what this is. What she really left for me. Not for her debt. For me.”

Ah Ling studied me. The fear was still there, but it was now alloyed with a grim resolve. We were sisters of a different sort, bound not by blood but by the same indelible ink in the same damned ledger.

“I will take you to the bus station,” she said. “The night bus to KL. It is less watched.”

We paid for the untouched drinks. The night air was cooler now, smelling of distant jasmine and exhaust. As we walked to the car, she spoke again, her voice low.

“Tan Hock Seng. He has a office. In the old shophouses near Petaling Street. Third floor. The door is green. He is there on Tuesday afternoons. He sees no one by appointment. People just… wait.”

I memorized it. Petaling Street. Tuesday. A green door.
“Why are you telling me this?”
“Because you are right,” she said, unlocking the car. “You must go back. And when you knock on that green door, you should not go as the exhibit.” She met my gaze in the dark. “You should go as the rival curator.”

The bus station was a cavern of shadows and diesel fumes, echoing with the coughs of idling coaches and the murmur of displaced people. She bought the ticket for me, pressing it into my hand along with a small, folded paper bag.

“*Kaya* buns,” she said. “For the journey.”

It was a gesture of such normalcy it almost undid me. I took them, the paper warm and greasy.
“What will you do?” I asked her.

She hefted her bag with the cloth-wrapped book inside. “I will find out what happened to Li Hua. I will bring the story home. It is a small thing. But it is mine to do now.” She offered a faint, tremulous smile. “Good luck, little sister.”

I boarded the bus. It was half-empty, smelling of worn vinyl and sleep. I took a window seat near the back. As the bus pulled out, winding through the sleeping streets of George Town, I saw her still standing there, a small, straight figure growing smaller until she was swallowed by the night.

The bus gathered speed on the highway, the island retreating into a constellation of lights behind us. I was going back. The victory felt fragile, a soap bubble trembling on the edge of a razor. I had a name for my mother’s ghost. I had a key to a lock I couldn’t find. And I had a man in a linen shirt who believed I belonged to him.

I took out the *kaya* bun, but didn’t eat it. I held its warmth in my hands. Outside, the world was a black Monet again, the rubber trees and limestone hills just suggestions in the dark. I was between worlds, between stories. The orphan and the heir. The prey and the dealer. The exhibit and the curator.

I closed my eyes, but I did not sleep. I planned my visit to a green door.

# Chapter 8

## **Chapter 8**

The bus to Kuala Lumpur smelled of vinyl and the ghost of old cigarettes. I pressed my forehead against the window, but the glass was warm, the night outside a black void punctuated by the occasional sodium-orange smear of a roadside stall. The *kaya* bun sat in its greasy bag on my lap, a small, cooling weight. I had not eaten it. The gesture was sustenance enough, a fragment of normalcy I was afraid to consume and lose.

The highway was a river of dark, the bus its solitary, lumbering barge. I was between stories. The knowledge was a stone in my gut. Li Hua. A name. A ghost given shape. And a green door on Petaling Street, waiting.

The man in the linen shirt was a pressure against my spine. I could feel his regard like a physical touch, even here, miles of darkness stretching behind us. He believed I belonged to him. He believed I was an exhibit to be retrieved. The woman with the book had seen it. *You should go as the rival curator.* The words were a suit of armor I did not know how to wear.

Two seats ahead, a man in a faded batik shirt snored softly. Across the aisle, a young mother rocked a bundled infant. Ordinary people on an ordinary night coach. I envied them the simplicity of their destinations.

The bus shuddered, its engine note dropping to a grumble as we slowed. We weren’t at a scheduled stop. The lights of a lone petrol station appeared, a fluorescent island in the ink. The driver called out, “*Rest stop. Ten minutes.*”

People stirred, gathering bags, shuffling into the aisle. I stayed put, watching the exodus. The night felt too still, the station too bright. A bad diorama. I saw the man in the batik shirt amble towards the minimart. The young mother shifted her baby, stepping down onto the tarmac.

A car was parked at the far edge of the lit area, its engine off, its windows dark. A silver Mercedes. It hadn’t been there when we pulled in.

My hand went to the urn beside me, its celadon surface cool and smooth. A tourist, buckled in. My breath shallowed. This was the transaction. The bill coming due.

I saw him then. Not from the Mercedes. From the shadowed tree line just beyond the petrol station’s glow. He moved with a liquid, unhurried grace, a panther skirting a watering hole. He was tall, his face in shadow, but the cut of his shoulders, the way he carried his weight—it was the same. The man from the museum. The one who had watched me with the flat, assessing eyes of a zookeeper.

He wasn’t looking at the bus. He was looking at the young mother, who had paused to adjust her sling. He took a step, then another, closing the distance with terrifying quiet.

It wasn’t me he was after. It was the book. He must have tracked the woman, must have known she’d been with me. He was cleaning up. Erasing threads.

I was moving before the thought fully formed. Unbuckling the seatbelt, leaving the urn, the bun. I hit the bus steps and the humid night air wrapped around me, thick with the smell of petrol and frangipani.

“Hey!” I called, my voice sharp, a brittle thing in the quiet.

The young mother turned, startled. The man from the tree line froze, his head swiveling towards me. In the fluorescent light, I saw his face properly. Handsome, in a carved, empty way. His eyes found me, and the emptiness filled with a pure, focused interest. The exhibit had presented itself.

“You dropped this,” I said to the mother, walking towards her, putting myself between her and him. I held out nothing. My empty hand.

She blinked, confused, hugging her baby closer. “No, I…”

“Take it and get back on the bus,” I said, low and urgent, my eyes locked on the man.

Understanding, then fear, flashed across her face. She took my empty hand, mimed a grateful nod, and scurried back to the coach steps.

The man smiled. It was a thin, professional curve of the lips. “Miss Tan. You have saved me a great deal of trouble. Your consideration is noted.”

His voice was cultured, mellifluous. It made my skin crawl.

“She has nothing you want.”

“I disagree. She had a proximity to you. And you, Miss Tan, have something my employer very much wants returned.” He took a casual step forward. “The book was never yours to give away.”

“It was never his to own.”

The smile didn’t waver. “A quaint perspective. Now. You will come with me. Quietly. The bus will leave. These people will sleep. It will be a transaction, simple and clean.”

My heart was a frantic bird in a cage of ribs. I saw the silver Mercedes’s lights flick on. The chase was not a chase. It was a retrieval. Planned, efficient. He had been waiting. He had known which bus, which stop.

“And if I don’t?”

He sighed, a whisper of disappointment. “Then it becomes less quiet. And less clean. For everyone.” His gaze flicked to the bus, where faces were now pressed to windows, curious. The driver was watching, one hand on the door lever.

I was a green door. I was a locked thing. I took a step back, towards the bus.

He moved.

It wasn’t a run. It was an explosion of controlled motion, covering the distance between us in a heartbeat. His hand closed around my upper arm, his grip like steel cable. I cried out, more in shock than pain.

“Driver!” I yelled. “Close the door! Go!”

The driver’s eyes went wide. He hesitated, looking from me to the well-dressed man, to the idling Mercedes.

“*Now!*” I screamed, twisting in the grip.

The man’s other hand came up, a small, dark object in it. Not a gun. A syringe. The world narrowed to its beveled tip.

A blur of faded batik slammed into him from the side.

The snoring man. He wasn’t asleep. He was *hers*. The woman with the book. He moved with a street-fighter’s economy, driving a shoulder into the tall man’s kidney. The grip on my arm loosened. I tore free, stumbling back.

The two men grappled, a silent, vicious dance in the petrol-station glow. The batik man was older, smaller, but he fought with a feral, desperate precision. He was buying seconds. For me.

“Get on the bus!” he grunted, taking a hard elbow to the jaw.

The driver finally acted, the bus door hissing shut. The engine revved.

I looked at the batik man, at the blood on his lip. He met my eyes for a fraction of a second. It was a look of pure, uncomplicated intent. *This is my thing to do.*

The tall man broke the hold, the syringe flashing down. It sank into the batik man’s neck. His body stiffened, then went limp, collapsing onto the oil-stained tarmac.

The tall man straightened his linen shirt, breathing only slightly harder. He looked at the bus, at me standing frozen beside it. He took a step.

I ran.

Not towards the road, but around the back of the petrol station, into the swallowing dark. I heard the Mercedes engine roar to life, tires squealing as it pulled around to cut me off.

The world behind the station was a chaos of discarded pallets, tall grass, and the looming wall of the jungle. The highway was a ribbon of sound to my left. I plunged into the grass, thorns tearing at my jeans. The lights of the station faded. I was in the black Monet again, the world dissolved into texture and threat.

Headlights swept the tree line ahead. The Mercedes, crawling, searching.

I dropped to my hands and knees, crawling through the damp undergrowth, the smell of wet earth and decay filling my nose. I thought of the batik man, his body on the tarmac. A transaction. He had paid.

The headlights passed. I scrambled up, running parallel to the highway, staying in the tree shadow. My lungs burned. I had no plan, only the animal need to put distance between myself and the syringe, and the empty smile.

A motorbike’s whine cut through the night, approaching from the direction the bus had gone. It slowed. A small, ancient Honda, its rider a silhouette.

I froze, pressed against a tree trunk.

The rider killed the engine. “*Kakak!* Sister! Here!”

It was the young mother. She had the baby strapped to her chest with a *selendang*, the motorbike idling between her legs. Her face was pale, determined.

“How did you—”

“My husband’s bike. In the bus cargo. I saw. I *saw*.” She gestured frantically. “Get on. Now.”

I didn’t hesitate. I swung onto the narrow seat behind her, my arms wrapping around her waist. The baby between us gurgled softly.

The motorbike coughed back to life. She didn’t turn on the headlight. She nudged us forward, bumping onto the highway’s rough shoulder, away from the petrol station, away from the searching silver gleam.

We rode in darkness, the wind whipping my hair. I clung to her, this stranger, this young mother whose name I didn’t know. She drove with a fierce, focused competence, leaning into curves, her body a shield for her child and for me. The sacrifice demanded had not been from me. It had been taken from the batik man. And this was the loyalty offered in return, reckless and absolute.

After ten minutes, she flicked the headlight on. The world resolved into a tunnel of asphalt and fleeing trees.

“Where are we going?” I shouted over the wind.

“My aunt’s house. Near Tapah. Off the highway. He will not find you there.”

“You shouldn’t be doing this. You have your baby.”

She glanced back, her eyes fierce in the mirror. “He was going to take me. To ask about you. You stood between. Now I stand between.” She faced the road again. “It is a transaction.”

We left the highway at the next exit, winding through sleeping village roads, past closed shops and wooden houses on stilts. The air grew cooler, smelling of wet clay and night-blooming jasmine. She pulled up beside a small, tidy house with a lighted porch.

An older woman appeared in the doorway, worry etched on her face. My driver—her name was Aisyah, she told me now—spoke to her in rapid Malay. The aunt’s eyes swept over me, taking in my torn clothes, my wild eyes. She nodded, once, and gestured me inside.

The house was simple, clean. A ceiling fan stirred the air. Aisyah unstrapped her sleeping baby, handing him to her aunt. She turned to me.

“You can wash. Sleep. In the morning, my cousin will take you to the train station. It is safer than the bus.”

I stood there, in the calm eye of the hurricane. The ordinary world. A ticking clock, a sleeping child, the smell of *teh tarik* from the kitchen. I had crossed a border, but the central conflict had followed me, wearing a linen shirt and driving a silver car.

“Thank you,” I said, the words utterly inadequate.

She shook her head. “Do not thank me. Just… win. When you go to your green door. Win for the man who slept on the bus.”

I washed in a small, tiled bathroom. The water was cold. I looked at my face in the mirror—a stranger with my mother’s eyes, wide with a fear that was hardening into something colder, sharper. The orphan. The heir. The prey. The curator. The roles bled together, a composite ghost.

I was given a thin mattress on the floor of the front room. Aisyah and her aunt slept behind a curtain. I lay in the dark, listening to the geckos chirp, to the distant bark of a dog.

I had escaped the special world of George Town, of museums and colonial ghosts. But the man in the linen shirt was not a ghost. He was a fact. He was in this ordinary world of petrol stations and village houses. He had people everywhere. He had a syringe. And he had my name.

I closed my eyes and saw the green door. It was no longer just a destination. It was a weapon. The only one I had.

The cousin arrived at dawn on a moped. He was a silent boy of about eighteen. He handed me a helmet and nodded towards the back of the bike. Aisyah pressed a packet of *nasi lemak* into my hands. No words this time. Just a squeeze of my arm.

We weaved through the waking village to the small train station. It was a humble, whitewashed building. The cousin bought me a ticket to Kuala Lumpur, third class. He pointed to the platform. Then he was gone.

The train, when it came, was a local, rattling and crowded. I found a seat by a window, the urn once again beside me. The world outside was the green smear of palm oil plantations, not rubber. But the effect was the same. A dissolving landscape.

I was going back. To the city where my mother had turned to ash. To a green door on Petaling Street. I had no allies left on the road. The woman with the book was gone. The batik man was gone. Aisyah had returned to her life.

I was alone with a name and a key.

As the train clattered south, I opened the *nasi lemak*. The coconut rice was still warm, the *sambal* a bright shock on my tongue. A transaction of kindness. I ate it all.

Then, from the bottom of the paper bag, a small, folded square of newspaper fell into my lap. Not today’s paper. It was brittle, yellowed. A classified page from years ago. A circle in faint blue ink around a single, brief listing.

*For Sale: Celadon funeral urn, Song dynasty style. Excellent condition. A family piece. Enquire: Green Door Antiques, 14 Petaling Street. Tuesday only.*

My mother’s urn.

She hadn’t just known the dealer. She had bought the vessel for her own ashes from him. A family piece. The final, vicious joke. Or the first clue.

The train plunged into a tunnel, the world going dark. In the sudden, roaring blackness, I held the clipping tight in my fist. I was not going to the green door as a rival curator.

I was going as family.

# Chapter 9

## **Chapter 9**

The train from Butterworth to Kuala Lumpur smelled of diesel and dried squid. A perfect, terrible circle. I pressed my forehead against the same cool glass, watching the palm oil plantations bleed into a grey smear as we neared the city’s outskirts, the world dissolving into a watercolour of exhaust and memory. My mother’s urn was beside me. The seatbelt was new, but the fray was beginning. I had strapped her in again. *Like a tourist*, I heard her whisper in the rattle of the tracks. *Coming all this way to be buckled up.*

But she had come this way before. For the urn.

The clipping was a live coal in the pocket of my jeans. *A family piece.* The words had etched themselves onto the backs of my eyelids. In the dark of the tunnel, they had pulsed. Now, in the flat afternoon light of the city’s approach, they were just facts. Cold and sharp as a curator’s probe.

The station in KL was a cathedral of noise and sweat. I moved through it like a ghost, the urn a weight in my canvas bag. The air was a thick broth of exhaust, frying oil, and humanity. It was not the same station I had left from, days or lifetimes ago. I was not the same woman. That woman had been carrying her mother’s ashes to a place she thought was home. This woman was carrying a weapon to a place she knew was a trap.

Petaling Street in the late afternoon was a wound that never closed. The market stalls bled neon and counterfeit silk, the air thick with the sizzle of chestnuts and the press of bodies. I moved against the current, a stone in a stream. Number 14 was not a shopfront. It was a green door, flush between a vendor of jade trinkets and a shuttered herbalist’s, unmarked except for the peeling paint the colour of moss after rain.

I stood before it. The key from the batik man was warm in my palm, slick with sweat. This was the ordinary world. The world of transactions, of dried squid and third-class tickets, of newsprint-stained fingers. And it was here, in this most ordinary of places, that everything I had left—my mother’s memory, my own fraying identity—was threatened. The green door was not an escape. It was the maw of the beast, sitting contentedly in the belly of the everyday.

I fitted the key. It turned with a click like a bone snapping.

The space within was a cave of shadows and dust. It was not an antique shop. It was a reliquary of absence. Teak cabinets loomed in the gloom, their glass fronts reflecting nothing. A single, naked bulb hung over a counter of scarred rosewood. The air was still and cool, smelling of camphor and neglect.

“You are late.”

The voice came from the deep well of the room. It was a dry voice, paper sliding over stone. He emerged from behind a tall cabinet, a man of indeterminate age in a white shirt gone grey at the cuffs. He was thin, his movements precise. His eyes were the colour of weak tea. He held a porcelain bowl, rubbing its rim with a cloth that left no shine.

“I didn’t know I had an appointment,” I said. My own voice sounded strange here, too loud.

“You have had one since the moment you left KL with her.” He set the bowl down gently on the counter. It made no sound. “The urn, please.”

It was a transaction. I had learned the language. I unzipped my bag and lifted the celadon vessel out, placing it on the rosewood between us. In the poor light, its glaze seemed to drink the shadows.

He did not touch it. He only looked. “She specified the Song style. A scholar’s choice. I had it from a collection in Penang. A family was dissolving their estate.” A faint smile touched his lips. “It suited her irony.”

“She bought it from you.”
“She commissioned it. There is a difference. She provided the… specifications.” His tea-coloured eyes lifted to mine. “You have her look. Around the mouth. The defiance.”

I felt the old self then, the curator’s daughter, the keeper of catalogues and polite distance. It rose like a ghost, wanting to ask scholarly questions: provenance, glaze technique, firing history. But the new self, the one forged on night trains and in safe houses, the one who had held a stranger’s hand as she died, saw only the trap. This man dealt in legacies. In turning memory into inventory.

“What specifications?” I asked.

He ignored the question. He picked up the urn, his hands sure, and turned it over. His thumb found a slight irregularity on the base, a bump in the ceramic no larger than a grain of rice. He pressed. With a soft, sighing click, the bottom of the urn detached. It was a false base, a shallow ceramic disc.

He upended the urn over the cloth.

A fine stream of grey ash whispered out. My mother. The final, physical truth of her. But then, something else. A small, dense object, wrapped in oilskin, thudded softly onto the cloth beside the ash.

My breath stopped.

The dealer unwrapped the oilskin with ritual slowness. Inside was a jade *bi*, a disc with a central hole. It was the size of my palm, the colour of winter sea, carved with a coiling dragon. It was not merely old. It was ancient. It hummed with a silent, terrible weight.

“This,” he said, “was the specification. The final piece of her collection. The one she could not log, could not display. The one that belonged to a different story.”

I knew it then. The story of the woman on the train. The story of the batik man, of empires and theft. This was the prize. The reason for the watchers, for the silence, for the fear. My mother had not just been a curator. She had been a courier. A thief. A keeper of a story so dangerous it had to be hidden in the vessel of her own remains.

The old self recoiled. The daughter, horrified. The new self stepped forward. The heir.

“They’re looking for it,” I said.

“They have always been looking. She was clever. She used the most obvious hiding place. The one no one would violate.” He rewrapped the *bi* and pushed it across the counter to me. The urn’s base, with its tiny mechanism, he set beside it. “They know you have it now. They let you run so you would lead them here. To the source. To me.”

“Why?”
“To clean the ledger.” He looked around his shadowy cave. “This place is a memory. It is time for it to be forgotten. And I am tired.”

The green door blew inwards.

It did not slam. It splintered, a silent explosion of painted wood. Two men entered. They were not the thugs from the train. They were older, quieter, dressed in the bland uniform of officials. Their faces were closed files. The first one held a small, black pistol loosely at his side. The ordinary world had ruptured.

The dealer did not flinch. He looked at me, and for the first time, I saw something in his eyes that was not blank. It was an invitation. “The back,” he said, a whisper. “The alley goes to the river.”

The man with the gun raised it. Not at me. At the dealer. A transaction of a different kind.

The old self was frozen, a curator facing a vandal. The new self was already moving. I swept the *bi* and the urn’s base into my bag. But I did not run. I picked up the cloth holding my mother’s ashes.

“She is not part of your ledger,” I said to the men. My voice did not shake.

The man’s eyes flicked to me, dismissive. His focus was the dealer. The source.

In that moment, I integrated them. The daughter who cherished the fragments. The woman who had learned to fight with the fragments. I was not one or the other. I was the bridge between. I had my mother’s defiance. And I had my own road-worn ruthlessness.

I threw the ash.

It was not a grand gesture. It was a practical one. The fine grey powder erupted into a cloud between us, a sudden, spectral fog. It filled the cone of light from the bare bulb, a storm of what was left of her.

The man with the gun coughed, his eyes blinking shut instinctively. The dealer moved. Not away, but forward. He grabbed the man’s wrist with both hands, forcing the gun upward. It was a pure, desperate mastery. Not of violence, but of sacrifice. He was saving me. The last transaction.

The gun went off. The sound was enormous in the enclosed space, a single, shocking crack. The dealer jerked back, a dark flower blooming on his white shirt. He fell behind the counter.

I did not see him land. I was already through the curtain behind him, into a storeroom reeking of mothballs, towards a rusted metal door.

The second man was on me before I reached it. His hand clamped on my shoulder, spinning me around. His other hand went for my bag. His face was a mask of bureaucratic irritation. This was just paperwork to him.

I did not think. I let my body do what it had learned. I dropped my weight, slipping from his grasp as Aisyah had shown me in her quiet kitchen. I drove the heel of my palm upwards, not to his chin, but to the soft hinge of his jaw. It was not a fighter’s blow. It was a curator’s blow. Precise. Targeting the flaw.

He grunted, his head snapping sideways. His grip loosened. I wrenched free, slammed my shoulder into the metal door, and stumbled out into the shocking humidity of the alley.

The river was a stink, a promise. I ran, the bag pounding against my hip. I did not look back. The definitive victory was not in the fight. It was in the carrying. I had saved the story. I had saved the *bi*. And in that cloud of ash, my mother had saved me. A final, selfless dispersal.

I ran until the alley met the concrete lip of the Klang River. The water was the colour of mud and petrol, carrying the city’s refuse. I stopped, chest heaving. Behind me, no sounds of pursuit. The green door had swallowed its own conflict.

From my bag, I took the oilskin package. The jade *bi* was cool, its dragon a frozen wave. This was the lingering evil. A thing of beauty that carried a curse of greed and death. It had poisoned my mother’s life. It had killed the dealer. It would poison mine.

Balance was not in keeping it. Balance was in breaking the chain.

I did not hesitate. I drew my arm back and threw the *bi*, not into the center of the river, but towards a dredging pipe that spewed a constant, churning slurry into the current. The disc of ancient jade flashed once, a green tear against the grey sky, and was swallowed by the roiling, hungry water. It would be buried in silt, ground against concrete, lost forever in the indifferent bowels of the city.

It was gone.

I stood there, empty. The weapon was used. The battle was over. The antagonist was not a man, but a legacy of possession. It was defeated. The air, thick with rot, felt clean.

I looked down at my hands. They were stained with river dust and the ghost of my mother’s ashes. I still had the urn, the false base, the empty bag. I had nothing. I had everything.

From upriver, a long, low barge sounded its horn. The light was failing, the sky bleeding to indigo. I had no ticket. No destination. The road was gone.

But in my pocket, the brittle newspaper clipping remained. *A family piece.* I took it out. In the twilight, I saw what I had missed. Below the circled ad, in the same faint blue ink, was a single word, a whisper in the margin.

*Remember.*

It was not her handwriting. It was the dealer’s.

I turned the clipping over. The other side was a theatre listing. A play at the old *Istana Budaya*. The date was from last year. A single line was underlined, not in blue, but in a sharp, familiar black ink I knew from a thousand museum acquisition notes. My mother’s hand.

*The past is not a room to be visited. It is a key to be forged.*

The barge horn sounded again, closer now. I looked up. It was not a barge. It was a police launch, its blue light slicing through the dusk. Cutting through the water, straight towards me.

They were not coming for the *bi*. They were coming for the story. And I was the only page left.

I crumpled the clipping in my fist. The hook was set. The past was not behind me in a green door. It was ahead, on the darkening water, and it had a blue, revolving light. I had cleansed one evil. But the memory? The identity? That chase had just begun.

# Chapter 10

## **Chapter 10**

The alley behind the shophouse smelled of wet cement and frangipani. I stood in the shadow of the overhang, the celadon urn cradled against my chest like a stolen child. The police launch had cut its engine fifty yards from the jetty, a silent, blue-lit predator gliding on inertia. I had turned and walked, not run, into the labyrinth of wet markets and welding shops that festered behind the riverfront. The instinct was old, learned from her: movement attracts, stillness confuses. I was a ghost returning to a haunted house, carrying the very thing that made me solid.

My aunt’s door was the same faded cobalt, blistered by sun and humidity. The brass knocker, a lion’s head with a tarnished ring in its mouth, felt cold under my knuckles. The sound was swallowed by the thick wood.

Silence. Then the shuffle of slippers, the click of a bolt.

The door opened a crack, revealing one dark eye, a slice of worried forehead. Auntie Mei. Her gaze dropped to the urn, then snapped back to my face. The door didn’t open wider. “You brought her home.”

It wasn’t a question. It was an indictment.

“I need to come in, Auntie.”

“The police were here. Two hours ago. Asking about a theft. About you.” Her voice was a dry rustle, like leaves in a drain. “They showed a picture. Of an empty display case.”

“It wasn’t a theft,” I said, the river-dust thick on my tongue. “It was a burial.”

Her eye blinked, slow and reptilian. The door stayed shut. “You stir the mud, and the dead fish float to the top. This house is quiet now.”

“The mud was already stirred. She stirred it.” I hefted the urn. “This is the elixir.”

A bitter snort from behind the door. “Poison, more like. She was always poison. In life, in death.” But the bolt slid back with a tired scrape. “Quickly.”

The front room was a museum of arrested time. The same rosewood cabinet, the same sepia photographs of unsmiling ancestors, the same persistent smell of camphor and mildew. But it felt smaller, a diorama I had outgrown. Auntie Mei stood with her arms crossed, a small, sharp woman in a floral housecoat. She didn’t offer tea.

“They said it was a national treasure,” she said. “That you are a thief.”

“It was a family curse,” I replied, setting the urn on the altar table beside a photograph of my grandfather. “And I am the exorcist.” I reached into the urn’s false base, my fingers finding the oilcloth pouch. Not the *bi*—that was silt and river now—but the other thing. The true elixir. I laid it on the table: the dealer’s notebook, the one I’d taken from his drawer as the police sirens wailed in the distance. A ledger of whispers.

Auntie Mei didn’t move. “What is that?”

“The story she bought. And the one she was sold.” I opened it to a page marked with a newspaper clipping—theatre listings from the *Istana Budaya*. My mother’s black-ink underline: *The past is not a room to be visited. It is a key to be forged.* Next to it, in the dealer’s frantic blue scrawl, a name. *Lin*. An address. Not in KL. In Ipoh.

My aunt’s breath hitched. A tiny, almost silent sound.

“You know this name,” I said.

“It is a ghost name.” She turned away, pretending to adjust a vase of plastic orchids. “It means nothing.”

“It meant something to her. She went to this play. She met this ‘Lin’. She was chasing this ghost, and it led her to that piece of jade. And that jade led her to a heart attack in a dealer’s back room.” My voice was flat, the monotone of a coroner. “The police want a thief. I want the rest of the ghost.”

Auntie Mei was silent for a long time. The only sound was the drip of the air conditioner, weeping its condensation into a bucket. When she spoke, her voice was far away. “Your mother… she was not a happy woman. She collected sadness. She thought if she owned the pieces of a broken thing, she could understand why it was broken.” She finally looked at me, her eyes old and exhausted. “You have her hands.”

I looked down. They were still stained. “I have her completion. The *bi* is gone. It’s at the bottom of the Klang River, where it belongs. Its story is over.” I tapped the notebook. “This story isn’t. The police will come back. They will have questions I can’t answer with the truth. I need the rest of the truth.”

“To give to them?”

“To understand what I’m protecting.” I picked up the urn. It felt lighter now, a vessel without its anchor. “She wanted me to have this. Not the jade. The chase. The identity. She left me a key, Auntie. Not to a room. To a forge.”

Auntie Mei sighed, a deflating of her entire small frame. She walked to the rosewood cabinet, opened a drawer that stuck with a whine. From beneath a stack of embroidered handkerchiefs, she pulled out a small, lacquered box. “She left this with me. The last time she came. She said if anything happened… if you came asking about the past… to give it to you. I thought she was being dramatic.” A faint, sad smile. “She always was.”

She handed me the box. It was light, the size of a paperback. I set the urn down and opened the clasp.

Inside, no jade. No gold. A stack of postcards, held together with a faded hair ribbon. The top one was a picture of the Ipoh railway station, white and colonial under a blazing sun. I turned it over.

The handwriting was my mother’s, but younger, less controlled. *He says it’s a family piece. He says it remembers. How can a stone remember? It’s just a story he tells to make it worth more. But what a story.*

The date was forty years ago.

Beneath it, another postcard. Penang Hill. *Met Lin today. He has the eyes of the piece. Green and full of ghosts. He knows the story. The real one. He says it’s not a treasure. It’s a witness.*

And another. The Kek Lok Si temple. *It was not an heirloom. It was a trade. A life for a life. Our name is not our own. It is a translation. A forgetting.*

My breath tightened in my chest. This was the elixir. Not a thing, but a trail. A life’s work of questioning. Her obsession laid bare, not as madness, but as archaeology. She had been trying to excavate our name.

Auntie Mei was watching me. “She was looking for a man named Lin. An old man, a storyteller. He was the last one, she thought, who knew the origin. Not the official origin. The dirty one. The one that happens in the shadows, not the history books.”

“Did she find him?”

“I don’t know. She stopped sending postcards. Then she started buying tickets to KL, not Ipoh. She said the trail had moved. To the dealers, the auction houses. The story had been… commodified.” Auntie Mei spat the word like a seed. “That’s when she changed. The hunt became about possession. About winning.”

I sifted through the postcards. The final one was blank, unused. Slipped behind it was a small, passport-sized photograph. A young woman, my mother, her hair in a long braid, squinting against the sun. Next to her, a young man with a sharp, intelligent smile. Not the dealer. Someone else. On the back, two words. *George Town. 1979.*

“Who is this?” I asked, my throat dry.

Auntie Mei took the photograph, her fingers trembling slightly. “I don’t know. I never saw this.” She studied it, a deep frown line between her brows. “But the face… there is a familiarity. In the shape of the eyes.” She looked from the photo to me, and her own eyes widened, just a fraction. “Perhaps a ghost is not always dead. Sometimes it is just… misplaced.”

The knock on the door was firm, authoritative. Not the brass lion, but the flat of a hand on wood.

We froze. The air conditioner dripped. *Plink. Plink.*

“Police! Open up!”

Auntie Mei’s eyes locked with mine. In them, I saw not fear, but a fierce, sudden calculation. She snatched the notebook and the box of postcards from my hands and shoved them into the drawer of the altar table, beneath a cloth. She pointed to the back of the house, to the kitchen.

“Go. Out the back. To the coffee shop on Lebuh Melayu. Wait.”

“The urn—”

“Leave it. It is just a pot. I will handle them.”

The knocking came again, louder. “Now, please!”

I hesitated for only a second. Then I was moving, silent in my stocking feet, through the bead curtain into the dark kitchen, out the warped screen door into a tiny, cluttered courtyard strung with washing. I did not look back.

The coffee shop was a cave of Formica and steam. I took a seat in the back, near the grumbling ice machine. My hands, on the sticky table, were empty. I had returned with the elixir, but I could not pour it. I had been recognized, but as a fugitive, not a hero. My old life wasn’t just ill-fitting; it was a cell with an open door, and I had walked out of it.

An hour passed. The *kopi* I ordered grew a cold, oily skin. Then Auntie Mei was there, sliding into the booth opposite me, her housecoat replaced by a simple cotton shirt and trousers. She placed a small, worn duffel bag on the seat.

“They took the urn,” she said, her voice low. “As evidence. They asked many questions. Where you went. What you took. I played the confused old woman. I gave them tea. I showed them the altar. I said you came to pay respects, you were distraught, you left quickly. I said I knew nothing about any jade.” She allowed herself a small, tight smile. “They are bureaucrats. They see what they expect to see. A grieving daughter. A superstitious old aunt. They will look for you at borders, at airports. Not here.”

“Thank you, Auntie.”

“Do not thank me. I did not do it for you.” She pushed the duffel bag towards me. “I did it for the ghost. For Lin. For the story she could not finish.” She leaned forward, her eyes intense. “They found the dealer. His body. In the river. Not far from where you were.”

The ice machine shuddered. A cold wire threaded my spine. “He was dead when I left him.”

“I believe you. But his neck was broken. The police think it was a robbery that became violent. They think you have his missing ‘treasure’.” She tapped the table with a blunt fingernail. “You have something more valuable. You have the reason. And someone else wants that reason silenced. The dealer did not just fall.”

The world tilted, re-forming around this new axis. The chase was not over. It had simply changed hunters. I had cleansed the object, but the memory it held was a live wire. And someone was cutting the power.

“What is in the bag?” I asked.

“Clothes. Money. The notebook. The postcards. The photograph.” She met my gaze. “The address in Ipoh. It is still current. I checked.”

I stared at her. This woman who had called my mother poison, who had barred the door, was now handing me the compass. “Why?”

“Because I am tired of quiet,” she said simply. “This house is a tomb. She was poison, but she was alive. She burned with a question. You have that same fire. It is… inconvenient. But it is not boring.” She stood up, placing a few ringgit on the table for the coffee. “Go to Ipoh. Find Lin. Find the rest of the story. Then you will know what to protect. And from whom.”

“And the police?”

“Let them look for a thief. You must be an archaeologist.” At the door of the coffee shop, she paused, a small, dark silhouette against the blinding street. “Your new ordinary world is not a place. It is a question. Get used to it.”

She was gone.

I sat in the humming chill of the coffee shop. The elixir was not a cure. It was a contagion. I had brought it back, and it had not healed my old world; it had revealed the old world was a fiction, a set dressing. The real world was this: a dead dealer, a missing ghost, a mother’s forty-year-old trail gone cold, and a police force looking for a box I had already emptied into a river.

I opened the duffel. On top of the clothes lay the photograph. My mother, young and alive. The man with the familiar eyes. *George Town. 1979.* I traced the edge of the photo. The past was not a room. It was a forge. And I was inside it now, the heat just beginning to rise.

The hook was not set; it was in my own mouth, pulling me forward. I had solved nothing. I had simply graduated from a pawn to a player in a game whose rules were written in ghost ink. The launch with the blue light was just a symptom. The disease was memory itself, and I was the only remaining host.

I slung the duffel over my shoulder. The road was not gone. It was just unpaved, and it led north, to a ghost named Lin, and to a truth that had already killed once. My hands, finally clean of river silt, were now stained with the ink of a deeper, more dangerous excavation. The chase had not begun. It had just remembered my name.

# Chapter 11

## **Chapter 11**

The bus from Butterworth to Ipoh smelled of damp upholstery and overripe jackfruit. I sat near the back, my duffel bag on the seat beside me, a stand-in for the celadon urn that had made the southbound journey. The world outside was a different green now—not the lush, liquid smear of the coastal plains, but the sharper, drier green of limestone hills, rising from the earth like the broken teeth of some buried colossus. The heat here had a weight, a mineral quality, as if baked from the stone itself.

I was not the woman who had ridden south with her mother’s ashes. That woman had been a passive thing, a vessel of grief and silt, watching the world dissolve. I was a different kind of vessel now. I carried a photograph, a name, and a contagion. The heat I felt was not from the sun. It was from the forge.

**Scene 1**

Ipoh welcomed me with the slow, dusty sigh of a place that had already lived its grandest life. Colonial façades, once the color of cream, were now stained a weary tobacco-brown. The ghosts here weren’t restless; they were retired, dozing in the shadows of deserted shop-houses. I found a room above a kopitiam on Jalan Sultan Iskandar. It was small, the walls the color of weak tea, with a ceiling fan that chopped the thick air into languid, warm slices. The window looked out onto a narrow lane where a lone chicken pecked at a patch of gravel.

I unpacked the duffel with a new economy of motion. The few clothes, the toiletries, the photograph placed carefully on the nightstand. My mother’s young face, the man’s familiar eyes. *George Town. 1979.* It was no longer a relic. It was a manifest. I had traded the urn’s quiet weight for this paper’s silent shout.

For three days, I did not search for Lin. I searched for the rhythm of the city. I learned the cadence of the coffee-shop uncles, their voices a gravelly chorus debating politics and football. I learned which hawker stall’s curry laksa made the eyes water just so, and which one’s was merely polite. I walked the concourse of the train station, a Moorish palace built for an empire’s promise, now echoing with the shuffling feet of pensioners and the tinny ringtone of a single phone. I was not hiding. I was acclimating. An archaeologist does not rush into the dig. She surveys the terrain. She listens to the silence between the stones.

My internal change was reflected in the external circumstance: I was no longer a tourist in my own history. I was a resident. I bought a local SIM card. I learned the bus routes. I let the dust of Ipoh settle on my shoes and did not brush it off. The fear that had been a constant hum in KL, in George Town, was gone. It had been replaced by a focused clarity, a cold engine turning over in my chest. The disease of memory had found its host, and the host, in turn, had developed an immunity to shock. I was thriving not in comfort, but in competence. The world was no longer a set dressing. It was a readable text, and I was slowly learning its grammar.

**Scene 2**

On the fourth day, I found the bookshop. It was tucked down an alley off Jalan Market, a cave of yellowing paper and quiet. The sign above the door, *Sutera Buku*, was faded to a ghost of itself. The bell that tinkled as I entered sounded like it was coughing.

The man behind the counter was perhaps seventy, his spine curved like a question mark over a spread-out Chinese newspaper. He wore half-moon glasses and a cardigan despite the heat. He did not look up.

I browsed the shelves. They were a taxonomy of loss: forgotten travel guides, outdated textbooks, romance novels with sun-bleached spines. In the back, in a section labeled *Sejarah Tempatan*—Local History—I found what I wasn’t looking for. A slim volume, its cover a water-stained illustration of a tin dredge. *Ipoh’s Echoes: The Gopeng Mines, 1930-1980*. I pulled it out. A slip of paper, a receipt from a pharmacy dated 1998, marked a page.

I opened it. The chapter was about the closures. The social fallout. A grainy photograph showed a line of men, their faces grimed, standing before a colossal, rusting bucket. My eyes scanned the caption. And there it was. A name. *Foreman Lim Chen*, it read. *Laid off 1978. Later worked as a security contractor in George Town.*

The air in the bookshop tightened. *George Town. 1979.*

I brought the book to the counter. The old man finally glanced up, his eyes magnified and watery behind the lenses. He looked at the book, then at me. His gaze was not the conductor’s blankness. It was a librarian’s assessment—calculating, curious.

“Specific interest,” he said in English. His voice was dry as the pages.

“The human cost,” I said, matching his tone. “It’s always more interesting than the machinery.”

A faint nod. He rang up the purchase on an ancient brass cash register that chimed with finality. As he placed the book in a brown paper bag, he spoke without looking at me. “Many come looking for treasure in those pages. Tin. Gold. They find only rust and ghosts.”

“I’m not looking for treasure,” I said.

Now he looked at me fully. “What are you looking for?”

“A person. A woman named Lin. She would be about sixty. She might have had a connection to the mines. Or to George Town.”

He was silent for a long moment, his fingers resting on the paper bag. The fan above us whirred like a tired insect. “Lin is a common name. Like a leaf on a tree.”

“This leaf left a mark on someone. A deep one.”

He took off his glasses, polished them slowly on his cardigan. “When you dig for one ghost, you disturb the soil for all of them. You understand this?”

I thought of the dealer in the river. Of my mother’s burning eyes. Of the blue light on the black water. “I’m starting to.”

He sighed, a sound of settling dust. “There is a place. A coffee shop near the Hakka association hall. Old men go there. They play chess. They talk about the past as if it is a country they can still visit. They might know a Lin. They might know many things.” He put his glasses back on, his eyes swimming back into focus. “But they do not talk to tourists. They talk to people who understand the price of things.”

“What’s the price?”

“Listening.” He pushed the bag toward me. “Not for answers. For the shape of the silence between the words. That is where the truth lives. It is not a coin you can pocket. It is a stain.”

I took the bag. “Thank you.”

“Do not thank me. I have given you nothing but a direction to more questions.” He looked down at his newspaper again, a clear dismissal. “You have the eyes for it. The fire. It is inconvenient. But it is not boring.”

The phrase, an echo of Aisha’s in the George Town coffee shop, struck me like a tuning fork. The cycle was completing itself. I was no longer the one receiving the cryptic wisdom; I was the one being recognized by it. I was the contagion, and this old man, in his cave of echoes, had diagnosed me.

“What do I owe you?” I asked.

“For the book? Twelve ringgit.” He glanced up one last time. “For the advice? Remember that the past is not a room you enter. It is a current. You are already in the water. Try not to drown.”

**Scene 3**

The coffee shop he spoke of was called *Kedai Kopi Sin Sin*. It was a stark, functional space: white tiles, metal tables, fluorescent lights that buzzed like trapped flies. The air was a permanent fog of steam from the coffee urn and smoke from the unfiltered cigarettes of the old men who inhabited it. They sat in clusters, the click-clack of mahjong tiles from one corner, the softer tap of chess pieces from another.

I became a fixture. I did not approach them. I took the same table each morning, ordered the same *kopi-o kosong*, and opened my book on the Gopeng mines. I read the same paragraphs over and over, not absorbing the words, but performing a role. I was an archaeologist at her dig, brushing away the topsoil with infinite patience.

Days passed. A week. The old men’s eyes, sharp as birds’, noted my presence, my consistency. I was not a fleeting curiosity. I was part of the furniture. I listened to the cadence of their Hokkien and Hakka, the rise and fall of arguments about football and forgotten scandals. I learned the shape of their silence. It was not an empty thing. It was a language of its own—a glance held a beat too long, a deliberate turn of a shoulder, a cough that punctuated a sentence meant to be overheard.

One humid afternoon, during a lull in the chatter, a man from the chess table stood. He was thin, dressed in immaculate but threadbare trousers and a collared shirt. He carried his chessboard, the pieces still in mid-game, and walked to my table. Without a word, he set it down opposite me and sat. He moved a red chariot. Then he looked at me, his face a map of fine lines.

“You read,” he said in careful English. “But you do not see the board.”

I closed my book. “I’m learning.”

He gestured to the chessboard. “This game is forty years old. My friend, he is gone. Stroke. But the game is not finished. So I play both sides. It teaches you to see the pressure. Not the pieces.” His eyes flicked to my book’s cover. “You look for pressure. Not tin.”

My heart was a slow, heavy drum. “I look for a person. A woman named Lin.”

He moved a black horse, capturing his own red pawn. A sacrifice to open a line. “Lin. A common name. This one… she had a talent. For finding things that were lost. Not objects. Connections. People who fell through the cracks of the big stories.” He looked up. “You have this talent also, I think.”

“Did you know her?”

“I knew of her. She was a… fixer. For a certain kind of problem. After the mines closed, many men were lost. Not just jobs. Purpose. Family. She helped some find a way back. Or find a way forward in a new direction.” He studied the board, his hand hovering over a cannon. “She stopped helping. Many years ago. Something happened. A job that went into deep water.”

“George Town,” I said softly.

His hand stilled. He looked at me, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of something behind the calm—a ripple of alarm. “You ask not like a scholar. You ask like someone following a trail.”

“I am.”

“Then you should know the trail is cold for a reason.” He moved the cannon, putting his own red general in check. A self-inflicted threat. “The man she helped in George Town. He was not a good man. He was a thief of a different kind. He stole… peace. He traded in secrets that should have stayed buried. Lin helped him, and then she vanished. The man, too, is gone. Dead, some say. Fled, others say.” He finally met my gaze. “The past is a forge, girl. It does not warm you. It consumes.”

The phrase, my own private thought on the bus, spoken back to me in this tiled room, sent a current through my veins. The past was not a linear story. It was a pattern, a resonance. It echoed.

“I need to find her,” I said, my voice steady. “It’s not about the secrets. It’s about a question my mother left behind. Lin is the only one who might know the shape of it.”

He leaned back, his assessment complete. “There is a place. An old *kongsi* house, near the river. It belongs to no clan anymore. It is a place for… forgotten things. If she is in Ipoh, she is a ghost. And ghosts live where the living have forgotten to look.” He gave me an address, a string of numbers and a lane name I didn’t recognize. “Do not go at night. The river mist is thick, and memories are sharpest in the dark.”

He stood, picking up his chessboard, the game still unresolved. “You play both sides now. You are the seeker and the thing sought. Remember which side you wish to win.”

He returned to his table. The conversation was over. I sat in the buzzing fluorescence, the taste of bitter coffee and his sharper words on my tongue. The peaceful moment was not one of resolution, but of alignment. The world had shifted into a new, precarious focus. The lasting impact of my journey was this: I could sit in a room full of ghosts and hold a conversation. I could look at a map of my own making and not flinch from the destination.

**Scene 4**

I found the *kongsi* house at dusk. The old man was right; it was a place the living had forgotten. It slumped at the end of a lane that dead-ended at the Kinta River, its wooden façade rotted into a spongy grey, its carved dragons blurred by decades of rain and neglect. The windows were boarded, but the front door, surprisingly, was slightly ajar, as if the house itself was taking a shallow, ragged breath.

This was not a scene for boldness. This was a scene for listening. I stood across the lane, in the shadow of a towering bamboo cluster, and watched. The river moved sluggishly, the color of dull jade. The air cooled, bringing with it the smell of wet earth and decaying vegetation.

For an hour, nothing. Then, a light. Not electric. The warm, fluttery glow of an oil lamp, deep within the house, visible through a crack in the boarding of a side window. A shadow passed before it—human, slow, deliberate.

This was it. The end of the trail, or the beginning of a deeper one. Lin, the ghost, the fixer, the woman who knew what my mother had been searching for in 1979. The woman who knew what the elixir truly was, and what it had cost.

I did not cross the lane. I did not push the door. The hook was in my mouth, pulling me forward, but I had learned the weight of it. I had learned that the chase was not a sprint, but a form of listening. The police were looking for a thief. Aisha had told me to be an archaeologist. The old bookseller had told me to mind the current. The chess player had told me I was playing both sides.

I stood in the gathering dark, the chorus of frogs from the riverbank rising to a deafening pitch. The light in the *kongsi* house was a single, unwavering point in the gloom. It was an answer waiting for a question. I had come all this way, through diesel and squid, through river silt and ghost ink, to stand on this forgotten threshold.

I knew, with a cold and certain clarity, that I would cross it. But not tonight. Tonight, I would watch. I would learn the rhythm of this ghost’s life. I would see what, or who, else this forgotten house attracted. The truth that had already killed once was behind that door. And I was no longer a woman running from her grief. I was a woman standing calmly in the forge, feeling the heat, studying the contours of the flame. The excavation was about to begin in earnest.

The road had not ended. It had simply turned from unpaved earth to rotten wood, and it led across a threshold into a darkness that was waiting, patiently, for me to remember my name. And I had. Every single syllable.

# Chapter 12

## **Chapter 27**

The train from Butterworth to Kuala Lumpur smelled of rain and disinfectant. I pressed my forehead against the cool glass, watching the green smear of the riverbank bleed into the orderly rows of young rubber trees, the world resolving from a watercolour of memory into something solid, something present. The seat beside me was empty, the frayed seatbelt fastened across the pale blue upholstery. It was a peaceful sight. She would have approved. *Finally*, she’d have sighed. *Travelling light.*

“Ticket, Miss.”

The conductor’s fingers, clean and clipped, tapped the headrest. I handed him the slip of paper. He punched it with a neat click, a sound of finality, and moved on. I watched him go, a man performing the simple sacrament of a journey’s middle, and I felt the ghost of a smile. I was no longer a woman dissolving. I was a woman returning, carrying the map of myself, fully drawn.

***

**Scene 1: The Changed Constellation**

Aisha’s clinic in Georgetown was no longer a hidden thing. A fresh coat of white paint gleamed on the shutters, and a discreet brass plaque—*Warisan Wellness—* caught the late afternoon sun. Inside, the air was still thick with the scent of ginger and lemongrass, but now it mingled with the clean, astringent smell of sterilized equipment. Aisha moved between her old wooden examination table and a new, modern cabinet, her movements a seamless blend of the ancestral and the now.

I stood in the doorway, watching her measure out a tincture for a young mother with a crying baby. Her voice was the same: low, melodic, a river over stones. But her posture was different. The defensive hunch was gone. She stood straight, the authority she’d always wielded now worn openly, like a well-fitted coat.

She saw me and her eyes crinkled. A flick of her wrist dismissed her patient with gentle finality. When we were alone, she didn’t hug me. She took my hands, turned them over, and studied my palms as if reading a newly inscribed text.

“The silt is gone from your lifeline,” she said. “The river has cleared.”

“It has a name now,” I said. “The river.”

She nodded, satisfied. “And the ghost?”

“Lin is no ghost. She’s a curator.” I pulled a small, tissue-wrapped bundle from my bag and placed it on her counter. “She asked me to give you this.”

Aisha unfolded the paper. Inside lay a single, withered leaf, its veins a complex, dark network against the brittle brown. “*Tongkat Ali*,” she whispered. “But not from any hill I know. This is from the old stock. The ones they said were wiped out by the flood in ’79.”

“She’s been cultivating them. In the dark, by the river. A secret garden. She said you’d know what to do with it. That it belongs to the town, not to a lab in Singapore.”

Aisha’s fingers closed gently around the leaf. Her eyes glistened. This was the thread: the stolen knowledge, the privatized cure, returning to its source. Lin, the fixer who had helped my mother smuggle the original samples out for testing, had spent a lifetime in penance, guarding the last true remnants, waiting for someone who would ask not *“What is it worth?”* but *“Where does it belong?”*

“She tended her garden,” Aisha said, her voice thick. “While the world forgot.”

“She remembered,” I said. “So you could.”

The chessboard in the coffee shop was different. The Formica table was the same, sticky with condensed milk, but the men who surrounded it were not the same. The old master, Mr. Fong, sat not as a challenger, but as a teacher. Before him sat the young police sergeant, Rizal, his uniform shirt unbuttoned at the neck, his brow furrowed in concentration.

“You see,” Mr. Fong said, moving a black knight with a tap of his knuckle, “you are still thinking like a policeman. You seek the culprit. The game is not about capture. It is about pressure. About the story the board tells.”

Rizal moved a pawn, a defensive, timid gesture.

I slid into the seat beside Mr. Fong. He didn’t look up, but a smile touched his lips. “The prodigal returns. And not in handcuffs, I see.”

“The case is closed,” I said. “The theft from the museum—an inside job by a curator deep in debt to a smuggling ring. The ‘elixir’ pages were a target of opportunity, already fakes planted by the ring. They’ve been recovered.” I didn’t mention Lin’s whispered name, the deal struck in the dark *kongsi* house: the genuine, dangerous formula for the alkaloid would remain a secret, buried with my mother’s final notes, which now rested at the bottom of the river silt. In return, a anonymous tip led to the recovery of the forged pages and the arrest of the real thieves. The official story was neat, satisfying. The truth was safer, submerged.

Rizal looked up at me, then back at the board. “You were a piece in play,” he said, not unkindly.

“I was,” I agreed. “And then I became the player. You were the white knight. Trying to save me from myself.”

He gave a short, embarrassed laugh. “I was trying to solve a crime.”

“You did,” Mr. Fong interjected, capturing Rizal’s queen with a sigh. “You just looked at the wrong board.” He turned to me, his eyes sharp behind his glasses. “And you? You learned to see the whole board.”

“I learned I was on it,” I said. “That was the first step.”

The thread of the law, the chase, the suspicion—it was resolved not in confrontation, but in a silent, strategic alliance. Rizal had his solved case. I had my freedom. The board was reset, but the players had changed their relationship to the game.

**Scene 2: The Broader World – The Ripple**

The old *kongsi* house by the river did not burn down. It did not become a museum. The morning after my vigil, I crossed the threshold of rotten wood.

Lin was indeed no ghost. She was a woman in her seventies, with eyes the colour of river stone and hands stained a permanent green-brown from soil and ink. She lived among crates of decaying ledgers, jars of specimens, and the fragile, thriving life of her hidden shade plants. She had been my mother’s guide in ’79, her conscience, and finally, her confessor.

My mother, the brilliant, relentless botanist, had found the compound. She had also seen its potential for abuse, for weaponization, for profit that would strip the land and the knowledge from its people. She had planned to publish, to claim her glory. Lin had shown her the cost. The argument on the riverbank that night was not about theft, but about responsibility. My mother, in her furious, principled despair, had thrown the original notebook into the river. A symbolic act. But she had kept copies. Fragments. The ghost ink.

Lin had thought the secret had died with her. Until I arrived, trailing the scent of diesel and grief, holding the other half of the broken map.

Together, in that house over the course of a week, we performed an archaeology of motive. We pieced together the full formula from my mother’s coded fragments and Lin’s living garden. And then we destroyed it. We burned the pages in the same oil lamp that had guided me, mixing the ashes with water from the river and pouring it back into the earth at the roots of the oldest *Tongkat Ali* plant.

The change in the broader world was not a headline. It was an absence. A potential catastrophe quietly averted. A piece of knowledge deemed too dangerous for any one person, corporation, or nation to hold, was returned to the ecosystem of story and soil from which it came. The ripples were small, local: Aisha’s new stock of genuine medicine. The protection of that stretch of riverbank, purchased anonymously by a trust. The world was not saved. But a small, specific part of it was healed.

***

**Scene 3: The Protagonist’s Reflection – The Excavated Self**

The plane banked over the Strait of Malacca, and Kuala Lumpur sprawled below, a circuit board of light and ambition. I was going home. But the word meant something different now.

I thought of the urn, empty now. I had not scattered my mother’s ashes on the wind or in the river. I had done something she would have understood. I had mixed them with the soil of Lin’s secret garden, at the base of the plants she had both loved and feared. My mother was finally part of the discovery, not its disembodied author. She was in the roots. She was in the process. She was no longer a weight I carried, but a nutrient in my own soil.

What had I lost? The comforting numbness of grief. The simple story of a daughter avenging a mother. The illusion that the past was a static country I could visit and then leave. I had lost my anonymity in my own life.

What had I gained? A lineage. Not a straight, clear line, but a rhizome—a tangled, underground network connecting Aisha’s wisdom, Lin’s guardianship, my mother’s brilliance and her flaw, the chess player’s strategy, the bookseller’s currents, the sergeant’s flawed protection. I was a node in that living web. I had gained a self that was not a solitary monument, but a conversation.

The memory of my mother was no longer a closed room filled with relics. It was a language. I could speak it now. I could speak of her courage and her arrogance, her love and her failure. I could hold the whole, complicated truth of her. In doing so, I had found the whole, complicated truth of myself.

I was not her. I was her consequence. Her most difficult, most rewarding specimen. And I was alive.

***

**Scene 4: The Final, Symbolic Image**

My apartment in KL felt both familiar and alien. It was clean, quiet, holding its breath. I unpacked the single bag. Clothes. A few books. And one new thing: a small, rough-fired clay pot from Lin. Inside, growing in a mix of river silt and garden soil, was a young, spindly *Tongkat Ali* seedling.

I placed it on the balcony, where it would catch the morning sun. It was a fragile thing. It would need careful tending. It would need me to remember the taste of the river air, the sound of the frogs, the weight of the silence in the *kongsi* house.

That night, I sat at my own desk. Before me lay a blank page. Not a page from a stolen manuscript, or a ghost-inked diary. My page.

I picked up my pen. I did not write about elixirs or thefts or ghosts. I wrote about a train. I wrote about the smell of diesel and dried squid. I wrote about the cool glass against a forehead, and a world dissolving into a Monet of exhaustion. I wrote about an urn, strapped in like a tourist. I wrote the first sentence of a story I now knew how to finish.

Because I understood now what the hook had been, pulling me forward. It was not the mystery of her death. It was the mystery of her life. And mine. The excavation was complete. The archaeologist had not just found the artifact; she had learned how to build a home around it.

The seedling on the balcony trembled in the city’s warm breeze. It was a thread of green in the vast, glittering grid of memory and light. It was a promise to tend. It was a map that would grow.

I wrote the next word, and the next, the rhythm steady, the current sure. The journey had not been about arriving at an answer, but about learning how to carry the question. I was no longer bleeding into the landscape. I was drawing its lines, claiming its colours, speaking its name with every syllable I remembered, and every one I was yet to write.

# Chapter 13

## **Chapter 13**

The words, once started, came like a slow, steady bleed. Not the haemorrhage of before, where I felt my life seeping into the indifferent soil of Penang. This was a deliberate, surgical release. A letting. I wrote about the train until the page was full, then I turned it over and wrote on the back. I wrote until the city outside my balcony window dissolved from the sodium-vapour orange of midnight into the pale, watery blue of pre-dawn. The *Tongkat Ali* seedling was a silent witness, its single compound leaf a dark cut-out against the brightening sky.

I stopped only when my hand cramped, the pen a foreign object welded to my fingers. The silence in my apartment was different from the silence of the *kongsi* house. That had been a thick, listening quiet, heavy with the breath of the past. This was a hollow quiet, the white noise of a city holding millions of other solitudes. It was mine to fill.

Sleep, when it came, was not the blank oblivion I’d known since my mother’s death. It was a shallow, porous thing. I dreamt not of ghosts, but of textures: the rough grain of the manuscript paper under my thumb, the slick cool of the river stones, the dry, papery feel of the *Tongkat Ali* root in Lin’s palm. I woke with the taste of ginger and regret on my tongue, the phantom scent of frangipani and damp earth clinging to my skin.

The manuscript was gone, returned to its spectral author. My mother’s urn was on my bookshelf, between a book on architectural history and a volume of Tagore’s poetry. It looked less ridiculous now. It looked like it belonged. The space it occupied was no longer a gaping wound, but a fact. A cornerstone.

I made tea. The ordinary ritual of it—boiling water, warming the pot, the wait for the leaves to steep—felt like a new language I was learning to speak. As I sipped, I looked at the stack of pages on my desk. The story of the train. It was a beginning, but it was a beginning written from the end. I had started at the moment of arrival, of consequence. The hard part, I understood now, was walking backwards into the fog. Not to find her, but to find the shape of the space she had occupied. To map the negative.

My phone, charging silently on the kitchen counter, buzzed. A KL number I didn’t recognise.

“Wei.”

“Miss Chan? This is Sergeant Goh. From the Balik Pulau station.” His voice was formal, but the cadence was familiar—the slightly too-careful diction of a man who dealt with bureaucracy and grief in equal measure.

“Sergeant. Is there news?” My voice was calm. I was surprised by it.

“A formality, really. The final report is being filed. ‘Death by misadventure.’” He paused, and I could hear the rustle of paper. “There was no… foul play. The pathologist confirmed the head injury was consistent with a fall on the wet stones. The alcohol in her system was significant, but not…” He trailed off, searching for the clinical term.

“Not the primary cause.”

“Yes. Not the primary cause.” He cleared his throat. “We will be closing the file. I have some of her personal effects. A wristwatch. A necklace. A few coins. You are listed as next of kin. You can collect them, or I can post them.”

I saw her then, not as I last saw her—composed, formidable—but as she must have been in those final, unguarded moments. Reckless. Alone. Reaching for something in the dark. The official verdict was a period at the end of a sentence I had already read. It provided no new meaning. It only confirmed the grammar of the event.

“I’ll come,” I said. “Thank you, Sergeant.”

“There is one other thing.” His tone shifted, a fractional drop into something less official. “A man came to the station. Asking about the case. An Englishman. He said he was a friend of your mother’s. A colleague from long ago.”

The air in my kitchen tightened. “What was his name?”

“He didn’t leave it. He seemed… disappointed the case was closed. He asked if we had found any papers. Notes. He was very specific.” Another rustle. “He said to tell you, if I spoke to you, that he was sorry he missed you at the house. That he had hoped to pay his respects.”

The Englishman from the airport. The one who had watched me. The one Aunty Tan had called a *hantu*, a ghost from the old days. He was no longer just watching. He was asking.

“Did he say anything else?”

“No. But he took a card. My card. I think… I think he may try to find you. In KL.” Sergeant Goh’s voice held a mild, professional apology. “I would not normally share this, but given the circumstances…”

“I understand. Thank you for the warning, Sergeant.”

I ended the call and placed the phone on the table. The sun was fully up now, painting a hard, bright rectangle on my floor. The seedling’s shadow was long and thin, a sundial marking a time I couldn’t yet read. The peace of the morning had acquired a new texture. It was not shattered, but it was now layered with a fine, persistent tension, like the hum of a distant generator.

My mother’s life had been a series of carefully guarded compartments. Her work. Her past. Her daughter. I had spent weeks breaking into one compartment, the one labelled ‘Final Days.’ I had found her secrets, her fears, her unfinished symphony of an opus. But this man was a key to a different lock. A older one. A colleague from long ago. What fellowship had she shared with him? What had they built, or buried, together?

I went to the bookshelf. I took down the Tagore and opened it to the flyleaf. Her handwriting, sharp and angular, slashed across the page: *‘For M. Who understands that to dig is to worship. – E.’* The inscription was dated 1998. A year before I was born. ‘M’ was not my father, whose name was Robert. Who was ‘E’? The Englishman?

The hook was no longer in my past. It was in hers. And it was tugging.

***

The drive to Balik Pulau felt like travelling through a palimpsest. The North-South Highway was a grey ribbon of familiar anonymity, but now I saw the exits not as distances to be covered, but as portals. The turn-off to Taiping, where she had done her early fieldwork. The road to Ipoh, with its caves she had once catalogued. The landscape was no longer a blur; it was a filing system for a life I was only beginning to index.

Sergeant Goh met me at the station with a small manila envelope. It felt absurdly light.

“It is not much,” he said, almost gently.

I opened it. The watch was a simple, sturdy Seiko with a worn leather strap. The necklace was a thin gold chain with a small, smooth jade disc. The coins were two old Singapore dollar notes and a British halfpenny from 1953. Trinkets. Totems. The physical sum of a person, reduced to what could be carried in a pocket. I held the jade disc in my palm. It was warm from the envelope. I had never seen her wear it.

“The Englishman,” I asked. “Can you describe him?”

Sergeant Goh leaned back in his chair, which creaked in protest. “Tall. Thin. Hair more grey than fair. He wore a linen suit. It was… very wrinkled. He spoke Malay, but with a heavy accent. Old-fashioned. Polite, but in a way that felt like a demand.” He frowned, searching his memory. “His eyes. They were very blue. Very direct. He looked at you as if he was already reading the report you hadn’t written yet.”

A scholar’s gaze. An excavator’s gaze. It mirrored her own.

“Did he seem angry? Sad?”

“Neither,” Sergeant Goh said after a moment. “He seemed… urgent. Like a man who has missed a very important train and is calculating the cost of the next one.”

I thanked him and drove not back to the highway, but into the heart of Balik Pulau. The town moved at its own stubborn, syrupy pace. I parked near the wet market, the air thick with the smell of ripe durian and salted fish. I needed to be somewhere she had been in those last weeks, somewhere neutral, somewhere that held no ghosts for me.

I found a *kopitiam* tucked under the shade of a massive rain tree. I ordered an iced *teh tarik* and took a seat at a plastic table still sticky from the morning rush. I spread my mother’s effects before me. The Seiko had stopped at 11:47. Night or day? The jade disc was unremarkable, the kind of thing sold in every Chinese jewellery shop for decades. The coins were curiosities.

It was the British halfpenny that snagged my attention. 1953. The year of the Queen’s coronation. Long before my mother was born. An heirloom? A souvenir? She was not a sentimental keeper of things. Every object in her life had a purpose, a reason. This coin had been in her pocket or her bag when she fell. A deliberate carry.

I turned it over. On the worn bronze, Britannia sat with her shield and trident, blurred by time and touch. I held it between my thumb and forefinger, feeling the faint milled edge. And then I saw it. A tiny, precise scratch on the obverse side, near the queen’s profile. Not accidental wear. A mark. I squinted. It was a single, minute arrow, pointing to the numeral ‘I’ in the date.

A direction. A marker. It was exactly the kind of clandestine, intellectual clue she would leave—not for just anyone, but for someone who knew to look. For someone like her. For ‘E’.

My skin prickled. This was no random keepsake. It was a message. And I had just announced to the Englishman, through Sergeant Goh, that I was in possession of it.

The *teh tarik* tasted suddenly too sweet, the ice clattering against the glass like a warning. I was not being pursued by a ghost. I was being drawn into a correspondence that had begun long before my birth. A correspondence conducted in stolen manuscripts, ghost ink, and marked coins. I had finished one excavation only to find the ground beneath me was a catacomb.

I paid for my drink and walked back to the car, the coin clenched in my fist. The heat of the day was a physical weight. As I reached my car, I saw a piece of paper tucked under the windscreen wiper. Not a parking ticket.

It was a page torn from a book. An old book, with yellowed, brittle edges. The print was faded, but I could make out a few lines of English poetry:

*“...And down the long and silent street,*
*The dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,*
*Crept like a frightened girl.”*

Oscar Wilde. *The Harlot’s House*. Beneath the fragment, in a handwriting I did not recognise—a tight, spidery cursive—was written:

*She preferred the later, messier drafts. The ones with the author’s regrets still bleeding in the margins. The museum closes at 5. Ask for the Selangor Club donation box. Come alone.*

No signature. Just the implication, hanging in the humid air like a threat. Or an invitation.

He knew I would come. He knew I would drive here. He had been waiting, watching from the dappled shadows of the rain tree, from the crowded anonymity of the market. The urgency Sergeant Goh had described was now a net, and it had settled softly over me.

I looked around. The street was bustling with ordinary life: aunties with bulging shopping bags, motorbikes weaving through traffic, a shopkeeper hosing down his sidewalk. No tall Englishman in a wrinkled linen suit. He was a whisper, already gone.

I got into the car, the torn page in my lap. The museum. The Selangor Club. In KL. He was leading me back, but not to my apartment. To a different layer of the city. A layer she had known.

The drive back to Kuala Lumpur was a different journey entirely. The landscape no longer felt like a filing system; it felt like a tunnel. I was moving towards something, propelled by a momentum that was not my own. The seedling on my balcony, the manuscript of my own beginning, the closed case of her death—they were all receding into the background, the personal and the resolved making way for the historical and the unresolved.

I thought of her phrase, the one that had haunted me. *The hook is in the past.* I had thought she meant her past. My past. But the past was not a single thread. It was a woven braid, and I had only been tugging on one strand. ‘E’ was another. And he had just given it a sharp, insistent pull.

***

The National Museum was a monolithic, modernist structure, a fortress of curated memory. At ten minutes to five, the crowds were thinning, the tour groups herding towards the exits. The air inside was cool, dry, smelling of polished stone and silent time.

I approached the information desk. A young woman with a severe bun looked up from her computer.

“We close in ten minutes,” she said, not unkindly.

“I was told to ask for the Selangor Club donation box.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her eyes flickered with a hint of something—recognition? Annoyance? “That collection is not on public display. It is in the archival wing. Access requires an appointment.”

“I was told to come today. At five.”

She studied me for a moment, then sighed softly, as if conceding to a familiar, minor nuisance. “Wait here.”

She disappeared through a door marked ‘STAFF ONLY.’ I stood in the grand atrium, beneath the massive mural depicting the sweep of Malaysian history. I felt insignificant, a speck of dust in the official narrative. My mother had always been contemptuous of these places. *“Museums are where history goes to die,”* she’d once said. *“Neatly labelled, behind glass, with the smell of defeat air-conditioned out of it.”*

The woman returned with a key. “Follow me.”

She led me through a labyrinth of corridors, away from the public galleries, into the administrative bowels of the building. The air grew colder. Finally, she stopped at an unmarked door, unlocked it, and flicked on a light.

It was a small, windowless room lined with metal shelves. On the shelves were boxes—dozens of them—neatly labelled in black marker: *“Selangor Club: Donated Artefacts, 1970-1995.”*

“The material is uncatalogued,” the woman said. “It was a bulk donation. Mostly minute books, old menus, photographs of cricket matches. You have fifteen minutes. I will lock the door at five-fifteen. Please leave anything you examine on the table.” She left, closing the door behind her with a soft but definitive click.

The silence was absolute, a dense, cottony quiet. I was alone with the detritus of a colonial gentlemen’s club, a place my mother would have despised. Why here?

I began scanning the labels. The boxes were arranged by year. My eyes went to the late 1980s, the period of her early career. 1987. 1988. 1989.

The box for 1989 was heavier than the others. I lifted it onto the solitary metal table in the centre of the room. The lid came off with a puff of dust that smelled of old paper and mildew.

On top was a layer of precisely what the attendant had described: typed minutes of meetings debating the cost of whisky soda, faded photographs of white men in cricket whites and solar topees. But beneath this mundane layer, something else.

A slim, leather-bound folio, not stamped with the Selangor Club crest. It was plain, worn black leather. I opened it.

Inside were not minutes, but sketches. Architectural sketches. Detailed, exquisite pencil drawings of Malay *kampung* houses, Chinese shophouses, Indian temple *gopurams*. They were annotated in a precise, technical hand—measurements, notes on timber joints, roofing materials. A scholar’s work. But not my mother’s hand. Her drawings were freer, more expressive, dashed off with a kind of impatient energy.

These were the work of a draftsman. A perfectionist.

I turned the page. The next drawing was of a specific building: the *kongsi* house in Penang. But not as it was now. This was a rendering of it restored. The broken roof tiles were whole. The collapsed verandah was rebuilt. The jungle was pushed back, a tidy garden in its place. At the bottom of the page, in the same precise hand, was written: *“Proposed Restoration. For E.C. Project ‘Memory Theatre.’ Feasibility Study. July 1989.”*

E.C. Elizabeth Chan. My mother.

My breath caught. ‘Project Memory Theatre.’ The phrase from her manuscript, the grand, unrealised opus. This was not just her dream. It was a shared project. A collaboration.

I flipped further. More drawings: the shophouse in Georgetown where Aunty Tan lived, rendered with a new, modern interior grafted onto the old shell; a rubber plantation manager’s bungalow transformed into a community archive. Each was a blueprint for a ‘Memory Theatre,’ a place where history would not die behind glass, but would live and be performed.

The final sheet in the folio was not a drawing. It was a map of Penang island. Three locations were marked with red ink: the *kongsi* house, the shophouse, the bungalow. Lines connected them, forming a rough triangle. In the centre of the triangle, a fourth mark. Not a building, but a geographic feature. A small, unnamed hill near Balik Pulau. Next to it, in the draftsman’s hand: *“Site A. The keystone.”*

The keystone. The central element that holds an arch together.

A soft click echoed in the room. The door opened. The attendant stood there. “Time is up.”

I carefully placed the folio back in the box, my mind racing. “Thank you.”

“Did you find what you were looking for?” she asked, her voice neutral.

“I’m not sure,” I said truthfully.

As I walked back through the hushed corridors, the museum felt different. It was no longer a mausoleum. It was a clue in itself. The Selangor Club, that bastion of faded colonial power, was the last place anyone would look for the seeds of my mother’s radical, post-colonial ‘Memory Theatre.’ It was the perfect hiding place. And someone had known to send me here.

The Englishman. ‘E’.

He wasn’t just a ghost from her past. He was the draftsman. The collaborator. And he had just shown me that my mother’s life’s work was not a solitary, crumbling manuscript. It was a blueprint. A plan. And part of it—the keystone—was still out there, waiting.

The hook was no longer just in the past. It was in the earth. On a hill in Penang. And it was pulling me back.

***

The city at dusk was a spectacle of glittering indifference. I stood on my balcony, the lights of KLCC twin spears of arrogance against the violet sky. The *Tongkat Ali* seedling was a stark, fragile silhouette. It was a thread, but now I saw it as one thread in a larger weave. A weave my mother had designed.

The torn page from Wilde, the marked halfpenny, the folio of drawings—they were not just clues. They were a test. A methodical, intellectual gauntlet thrown down by a mind that worked in symbols and layers. The Englishman was communicating in the only language he and my mother had shared: the language of hidden meaning.

I went inside and took down her urn from the shelf. I held it in my hands, the celadon glaze cool and smooth. “Who was he?” I asked the quiet ceramic. “What did you build together? And why did it fall apart?”

There was no answer, of course. Just the memory of her voice, sharp and clear: *“The most important discoveries are never the artifacts. They are the empty spaces between them. The shape of the loss.”*

The loss. Not just her death, but the loss of the ‘Memory Theatre.’ The loss of the collaboration. The loss of whatever had happened at ‘Site A.’

My phone buzzed again. An email. From an address I didn’t recognise: **architectus.memoriae@****

The subject line was blank.

The body contained only a geographic coordinate and a time.
```
5.3532° N, 100.2415° E
Tomorrow. Sunrise.
```
I copied the coordinates into a map. It resolved to a point. A hill. The unnamed hill at the centre of the triangle on the draftsman’s map.

The keystone.

He would be there. The Englishman. The draftsman. The ghost. He would be there at sunrise, and he expected me to come.

This was no longer an excavation of the past. It was a summons to its unfinished future. My mother’s story was not a closed loop. It was an arch, missing its central stone. And he believed, for reasons I could not yet fathom, that I was the one who could find it. Or that I was a part of it.

I looked at the stack of pages on my desk, the story of the train, of her ashes, of my beginning. It was a true beginning. But every beginning emerges from a prior, unfinished sentence. I had been writing my way out of her silence, only to be pulled into her oldest conversation.

I placed the urn back on the shelf. I packed a small bag: water, a torch, a notebook. The marked halfpenny. I would drive through the night. I would be on that hill before dawn.

The seedling trembled in the evening breeze, a tiny, tenacious flag planted in the concrete of my present. It was a map that would grow, she had said. But maps are not just for understanding terrain. They are for navigation. For journeys you cannot yet see the end of.

I picked up my pen one last time before leaving. I did not write a story. I wrote a single line on a fresh page, a message to myself, or to the version of me I was leaving behind:

*The archaeologist has found the blueprint. Now she must go to the ground, and see if the foundations remain.*

I turned off the light. The apartment was not empty. It was full of the questions I was taking with me. The journey had never been about arriving at an answer. It was about learning how to carry the question. And now, the question had a location. It had a time. It had a name, and it wore a wrinkled linen suit and had eyes the colour of a forgotten sea.

I closed the door. The hook was in the earth, and it was pulling.

# Chapter 14

## **Chapter 14**

The road to the hill was a black ribbon unspooling into a deeper black. My headlights carved a tunnel through the sleeping air, the beam catching the startled eyes of a nightjar before it vanished into the void. The map was on the passenger seat, the draftsman’s red triangle a wound on the paper. The hill had no name on any modern chart. It was a cartographic silence, a place the world had agreed to forget.

I drove with the windows down. The night smelled of wet clay and the faint, peppery scent of flowering lantana. It was the smell of my childhood, of the overgrown lots at the edge of town where we weren’t supposed to play. A memory surfaced, unbidden: my mother, kneeling in the dirt of our tiny garden, her hands pressing a seedling into the earth. Not planting it, I realised now. *Anchoring* it. Her movements were not those of a gardener hoping for bloom, but of an engineer securing a load-bearing member. I had watched from the back steps, sucking on a slice of sour mango. She had looked up, her face smudged with soil, and said nothing. But her eyes held a specific gravity, a density of purpose that pulled at me even then. I had looked away, back to my mango. The hook was in the earth, even then.

The tarmac gave way to gravel, then to a packed-earth track that wound up the foothills. The car jolted over ruts, its undercarriage scraping on unseen stones. Each impact travelled up my spine, a percussion of ascent. I turned off the music I hadn’t been hearing. The silence that replaced it was textured, layered: the crunch of tyres, the thrum of the engine, the chorus of frogs from an unseen *kampung* stream. And beneath it all, the low hum of my own blood. I was a needle, drawn north.

I parked where the track dissolved into a wall of vegetation. The air was cooler here, a thin, high-altitude chill that carried the smell of damp moss and rotting leaves. I strapped the torch to my forehead, shouldered my bag. The halfpenny was a cold circle in my palm. I closed my fingers around it, feeling the crude file marks against my skin. A key, or a ticket.

The climb was not steep, but it was intimate. The jungle pressed in, vines brushing my shoulders like inquisitive fingers, roots snaking across the path to trip the unwary. My torch-beam was a frail probe, illuminating a world of frantic, minute activity: beetles like polished onyx scuttling under leaves, the geometric lace of a spiderweb jewelled with dew. I was an intrusion. The forest accepted my passage with a dense, vegetative indifference.

I thought of the Englishman. The draftsman. The ghost. Why a hill? High ground was for surveyors, for generals, for radio transmitters. It was for people who needed to see, or to be seen. He was a man of lines and angles, of plans drawn on flat paper. A hill was a defiance of the flat. It was a problem in three dimensions. Perhaps that was the point. The keystone is not understood on the ground. It is understood from the arch.

The trees began to thin. The undergrowth fell away, replaced by a carpet of coarse *lalang* grass that whispered against my jeans. The sky above was a vast, indigo bowl, dusted with the faintest sugar-spill of stars. I emerged onto the summit not with a gasp of revelation, but with a slow unclenching of the forest’s grip.

The hilltop was a bald, grassy dome, perhaps fifty yards across. It felt less like a natural formation and more like a scalp, shaved clean. At its centre, a dark, rectangular shape resolved in my torchlight: a concrete plinth, low and squat, stained with lichen. A foundation. For a hut, a shed, a watchtower. Something that was no longer there.

I was not the first to arrive.

He stood at the far edge of the clearing, a silhouette against the lesser darkness of the sky. He was not looking at me. He was looking east, where a hairline crack of palest grey was beginning to fracture the horizon. He wore the same linen suit, now more rumpled, as if he had slept in it. The breeze up here was stronger, plucking at his trousers, at the few wisps of white hair above his ears.

I did not speak. I walked towards the centre, towards the plinth. My footsteps were loud in the grass. He did not turn.

I stopped by the concrete. Its surface was pocked and weathered. But in its centre, someone had cleared the lichen. A design had been incised into the wet concrete decades ago, now hardened into permanence. It was not the draftsman’s triangle. It was a series of concentric circles, like a target, or a ripple. At its very centre was a small, round depression. A socket.

My hand went to the halfpenny in my pocket. The size was right.

“It’s not a keystone.”

His voice was dry, carried on the wind. It held no surprise at my presence. It was the voice of a man continuing a conversation paused only moments before.

I turned. He had finally faced me. In the pre-dawn gloom, his eyes were not the colour of a forgotten sea. They were the colour of flint. Old, dry, and capable of spark.

“What is it, then?” My own voice sounded rough, unused.

“A plumb bob.” He took a few steps closer, his movements stiff. “The keystone is a metaphor. A necessary one, for the mind that thinks in stories. But the work is done with simpler tools. A level. A square. A plumb line.” He gestured to the design on the concrete. “This was the anchor point. The fixed reference. From here, you could ensure everything else was true.”

He stopped a few yards away. He studied me not as a person, but as a reading on a theodolite. Assessing alignment.

“She told you about the arch.”

It was not a question. I nodded.

“She understood the principle. The distribution of force. The necessity of the central, locking piece.” He looked back towards the lightening east. “But she was the architect. I was merely the draftsman. And you… you are the inheritor of the site. The one who finds the foundation when the arch is gone.”

The first true light of dawn was not a colour. It was a dilution of darkness. The world began to separate itself from the void. The grassy dome, the surrounding treetops, the man before me—all gained edges, substance.

“Why am I here?” I asked. “You didn’t bring me here for a history lesson. You could have written that in a letter.”

“A letter is a closed loop,” he said, echoing my own thought from the night before. “This,” he gestured between us, at the hill, at the waking world, “is a field. And the truth of a field is only visible in a certain light, from a specific angle. At a precise time.” He looked at the horizon. “Now.”

The sun breached the distant mountain range not as a disk, but as a blade. A single, searing line of gold cut across the landscape. And as it did, something happened on the hill.

The long *lalang* grass, silvered with dew, caught the light. But it did not simply glow. The angle of the light, the specific topography of the hill, caused the shadows cast by the grass to fall in perfect, parallel lines. And those lines, radiating from the concrete plinth, aligned with notches in the distant tree line, with the hump of a faraway hill, with the glint of a river bend miles below. The concrete plinth with its concentric circles was not just a foundation. It was a gnomon. The hill was a sundial on a colossal, landscape scale.

And the lines pointed.

One shadow-line, black and sharp as a ruling-pen stroke, pointed directly to a distinctive, twin-peaked hill on the northern horizon. Another bisected the gap in a distant rubber plantation I had driven past hours ago. A third aimed true east, down the valley I had climbed from.

The draftsman was watching my face. He saw the understanding dawn, harder and clearer than the sun.

“A map,” I whispered. “The hill is a map.”

“A map is not a drawing,” he said. “A map is a relationship. Between here and there. Between then and now. This,” he tapped the concrete with the toe of his scuffed leather shoe, “is the ‘here’. The ‘then’ is 1952. The ‘there’…” He followed the longest, most definitive shadow-line with his gaze. It pointed northwest, into the deepest, oldest part of the forested range. “The ‘there’ is what we were trying to protect.”

“The seed bank.”
The words left my lips before I knew I had them. They felt true in the way a keystone feels true when it slides into place—a solid, satisfying click of inevitability.

He did not smile. But the severe line of his mouth softened by a micron. A draftsman’s acknowledgement of a correct calculation.

“The *concept* was a seed bank. A repository for cultivars, for rare strains of rubber, of rice, of fruit trees. A legitimate, botanical endeavour. Perfect cover.” He knelt stiffly by the plinth, his joints cracking. He ran a hand over the incised circles. “The reality was an archive. Of a different kind.”

The sun was fully above the horizon now, the magic of the aligned shadows dissolving into the general flat light of day. The map had been visible for perhaps three minutes. A secret that told itself only once a day, to those who knew where and when to stand.

“What was in it?” I asked.

He looked up at me. “What is ever archived? What people fear to lose. Stories. Testimonies. Records. Proof. In 1952, the Emergency was… ripening. The jungle was not just a place of conflict. It was a place of silence. A machine for making things disappear. We—a very small, very frightened ‘we’—wanted to create a place where some things could not disappear. A place outside the official maps. A memory, built into the land itself.”

“We.” I let the pronoun hang. “You and my mother.”

“And others. A planter with a conscience. A clerk with access to police files. A journalist who knew too much. Your mother… she was the catalyst. She had the mind for it. The architectural mind. She saw the land not as territory, but as structure. She designed the system. The arch was her metaphor, but this,” he slapped the concrete, “this was her genius. A map that could not be confiscated. A set of directions that only the land itself could give, at a time of its own choosing. You needed the blueprint—my drawing—to find the hill. And you needed the hill, at dawn, to find the archive.”

I thought of the seedling on my balcony. *A map that will grow*.
“But it’s gone,” I said. “The archive. You said ‘was’. You said ‘what we were trying to protect’.”

He pushed himself to his feet, a slow, arduous process. “The archive was compromised. Not discovered, but… suspected. The network was fragile. People were arrested. People talked. The location was never betrayed, but the operation was terminally endangered. In the end, the greatest threat to a secret is not exposure, but the erosion of the people who keep it.” He looked at me, and for the first time, I saw not flint, but a profound, weathered fatigue. “We sealed it. We used the very principles of the arch. We removed the keystone. Not a physical one. The procedural one. The knowledge of the final step. Without it, the archive is just a hole in the ground. Inaccessible. A tomb.”

The wind picked up, sweeping across the grassy dome. It carried the sun’s warmth now, and the smell of hot grass.

“And the keystone?” I asked, though I already knew. I felt its weight in my pocket.

“Was divided. For safety. One part remained a diagram, a concept—the triangle on the map. The other part became an object. An ordinary object, to be passed on, through the most secure channel we knew.” He nodded at my clenched fist. “Through love. Through inheritance. Through story.”

I opened my hand. The marked halfpenny lay on my palm, the filed edge catching the sun.

“It’s a key,” I said.

“It is one half of a bearing,” he corrected. “The hill gives you the direction. The coin gives you the distance. Together, they take you to the door. But the door, Miss Tan, is still sealed. And I do not have the combination. That died with your mother. She was the only one who knew the final sequence. She said it was not something that could be written down. It was something that had to be remembered. And she chose not to tell me.”

The hook in my earth pulled so hard I felt my roots strain.
“But she *did* tell me.”
The words were out, quiet and certain.

He went very still. “What do you mean?”

“She didn’t use words. She wouldn’t. That was her rule. She taught me through… everything else. Through the way she planted a tree. Through the stories she didn’t tell. Through the silence she left.” I walked to the plinth, knelt where he had. I placed the halfpenny into the round depression at the centre of the circles. It fit perfectly. A dull, copper plug in a stone socket. “She taught me how to listen to the silence. And she left me a story. A story about a train, and ashes, and a beginning. A story I had to write to understand. That story *is* the combination. I know it is.”

He stared at me, and for a fleeting second, the draftsman’s precise mask slipped. I saw a vortex of hope and terror and a desperate, decades-old longing. “You believe you can open it.”

“I believe I have to try.” I stood up, leaving the coin in its socket. A offering. A promise. “You gave me the location. The time. The name. Now you have to give me the choice.”

The sun was high now, bleaching the mystery from the hill. It was just a grassy knoll with an old concrete slab. The magic had retreated, waiting for tomorrow’s dawn.

The Englishman looked from me to the coin, to the northwest where the longest shadow had pointed. He seemed to shrink inside his suit, not with defeat, but with the final, exhausting transfer of a burden.

“The bearing from this point is 312 degrees magnetic,” he said, his voice reverting to a flat, technical recital. “The distance is 5.2 miles. The terrain is Class 4 jungle. There is no path. There will be leeches. There may be other things that have made their home in a place long forgotten by men.” He finally met my eyes. “If you do this, you do not go as an archaeologist. You go as the keystone. And a keystone, once placed, cannot be removed without the collapse of the entire structure. Do you understand?”

I understood. This was no longer about uncovering my mother’s past. It was about activating it. I would not be digging up a tomb. I would be opening a door. And I had no idea what was on the other side, or if it could ever be closed again.

I looked northwest. The forest was a solid, impenetrable wall of green. Somewhere in its heart, 5.2 miles on a bearing of 312 degrees, was a door my mother had sealed. A silence she had built. And the only key was the story of her death, and of my beginning.

I pulled the halfpenny from the socket. It left a perfect, dry circle in the concrete. I put it back in my pocket. The hook was no longer in the earth. It was in me. And it was pulling me into the green.

“I’ll need a better map,” I said.

For the first time, the ghost of a smile touched the draftsman’s lips. It was a grim, grateful thing. He reached into the inner pocket of his linen jacket and produced not a paper map, but a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. He handed it to me.

I unfolded the cloth. Inside was a brass compass, old but impeccably maintained. Its needle trembled, then settled. North. And beneath it, on a yellowed card set into the lid, was a hand-drawn sketch of a door. Not a wooden door. A door made of concrete and stone, set into a hillside. Around its edges were symbols: not letters, but small, precise drawings of seeds. A rubber seed. A rice grain. A rambutan.

And at the centre of the door, a circular keyhole.

“The foundation remains,” he said. “The arch is waiting. The story is yours to finish.”

I closed my fingers around the compass. The brass was warm from his body. I had come for answers and been given a navigation. I had come to find a ghost and been handed a responsibility. The past was not a place to visit. It was a structure to enter. And I was now part of its architecture.

I turned and walked back towards the tree line, towards the car, towards the 5.2 miles of jungle that stood between me and the sealed silence of my mother’s greatest act. I did not look back. I could feel his gaze on me, a final, verifying measurement. Then I entered the green shade, and the hill, and the draftsman, and the clear light of morning were gone.

The journey had never been about arriving at an answer. It was about learning how to carry the question. Now, the question had a weight. It had a bearing. It had a door. And in my pocket, a filed-down halfpenny clicked softly against a brass compass, a tiny, metallic heartbeat counting down the steps into the waiting, vegetative dark.

## **Chapter 15**

The jungle did not swallow me. It received me. The green shade was not a curtain but a solvent, dissolving the clear, measured world of the draftsman and his hill. Here, sound was no longer separate from substance. The drone of cicadas was the air itself, vibrating. The distant call of a gibbon was a rip in the canopy. My own breathing was an intrusion, a coarse, mechanical thing against the seamless hum of photosynthesis.

I walked. The compass in my left hand was a point of cool certainty. Its needle held true north, a fact that felt absurdly theoretical here, where the path was a suggestion made by the absence of thorns. The filed-down halfpenny in my pocket was the counterpoint, a warm, worn disc of personal gravity. They clicked together with each step, a quiet, binary code: *here, there. Past, future. Mother, me.*

Five point two miles. The draftsman’s precision was a gift of geometry in a world of fluid green. It gave the journey edges, made it a problem of logistics, not metaphysics. I could do logistics. I had logged the inventory of my mother’s apartment, had arranged the shipment of her celadon urn. I could count steps.

The first mile was a slope of mud and memory. The rain from the night before had not reached this side of the hills, but the ground remembered it, releasing the scent of wet clay and rotting leaves—the smell of my childhood garden after a storm. My mother would stand on the porch, her hands on her hips, surveying the drowned flowerbeds. *“Look,”* she’d say, not with dismay, but with a surgeon’s calm. *“Now you can see the bones of the land.”* I never saw bones. I saw mess. But now, slipping on a slick root, my hand shooting out to brace against the trunk of a *meranti*, I understood. The mud was sliding away to reveal a ribcage of stone. The land had a skeleton. I was walking on its spine.

The second mile, the trees changed. The rubber plantations at the fringes gave way to older, more particular things. A *pulai* tree, its buttress roots like stone sails. A cluster of wild ginger, its red blooms like surgical instruments laid out on a green cloth. I saw no door. I saw only the relentless, intricate business of life elbowing for space. My mother’s voice, clipped and tutorial, narrated the walk. *That is a strangler fig. It begins as a seed in a bird’s dropping, high in the branches. It sends roots down, a gentle cage at first. Then it squeezes. It becomes the tree it killed.* I looked at the monstrous, beautiful lattice of one such fig, consuming a *chengal*. It was not murder. It was a merger. A new architecture.

I stopped by a stream, water the colour of weak tea over sand the colour of bone. I cupped my hands and drank. The water tasted of tannin and distance. I took out the cloth-wrapped compass, unfolded it on a flat rock. The needle shivered, then settled. The sketch of the door in the lid looked even more improbable here, a stark, human geometry against the organic chaos. A door of concrete and stone. Symbols of seeds. A circular keyhole.

The hook in my chest, the one that had first been set when I pulled the surveyor’s marker from the earth, gave a dull tug. Not towards the north the compass showed, but downwards. Into the soil beneath my feet. The foundation remains, he had said. I was standing on it.

The third mile was a climb. The land rose in a series of muddy steps and moss-slick boulders. My city lungs burned. Sweat glued my shirt to my back, a second skin of salt and effort. The intellectual quest had become animal. I was a body moving through resistant matter, my mind reduced to a simple, rhythmic litany: *lift, place, push. Don’t look up. Just the next footfall.* The ghosts here were not spectral. They were muscular: the ghost of my own fatigue, the ghost of my mother’s impossible stamina. She would have taken this hill without breaking her sentence structure.

I found the first marker at the crest of the rise.

It was not a marker meant to be found. It was a consequence. A spill of concrete, grey and aged to the colour of a dove’s breast, had poured down a short rock face and hardened decades ago. It was a frozen waterfall of human intention. In it, like fossils in shale, were impressions. The weave of burlap sacking. The round imprint of a tin pail’s base. And at the edge, clear as a signature in wax, the perfect, five-fingered print of a hand, small and strong. A woman’s hand.

I knelt. I did not touch it. The urge to lay my own hand over the print, to feel the cool negative space her heat had left, was a physical ache. But it would have been a violation. This was not a relic. It was a moment. A worker, mixing concrete, had steadied herself here as the slurry spilled. She had pushed back, saved what she could, left this accidental autograph in the medium of her labour.

My mother’s hands. Capable of stitching a silk *kebaya* collar one minute and wrestling a stubborn generator cord the next. I had watched them knead dough, the heels of her palms pushing with a rhythmic, definitive force. They were hands that built and repaired and held things together. They were also the hands that had, in the end, let everything go, arranged neatly on a hospital blanket, still and light as sparrow’s wings.

This hand in the concrete was not hers. It was from another woman, another time. But it was of her. It was a hand that knew the weight of materials, the resistance of the physical world. It was a hand that built.

The hook in my chest turned. It was no longer pulling. It was aligning.

I rose and walked on, leaving the fossilized hand to its silent testimony. The compass now felt redundant. I was following a different map, one charted in spilled concrete, in the subtle, older paths worn not by animals but by daily human passage, now almost healed by green. A vein of crushed *serai* grass that still gave up a ghost of lemon scent. A series of flat stones placed across a perpetually damp patch, their surfaces worn smooth by boot soles.

The fourth mile descended into a shallow valley where the light turned the colour of honey, filtered through a high canopy of *kapur* trees. The air grew cooler, damper. The insect hum deepened into a resonant thrum that vibrated in my molars. And then I saw it.

Not the door. Its echo.

A long, low mound, like the buried spine of some great beast, covered in a fur of moss and creeping fern. It was too straight, too regular to be natural. I approached, my breath tight in my throat. At one end, the mound was cut through. A cross-section. Time and roots had cracked and bulged the concrete, but its form was undeniable: a foundation wall, three feet thick. Rebar, rusted to a deep ochre, thrust out of the broken edge like broken bones. And within the concrete aggregate, I saw the stones—smooth, water-worn river stones, mixed in with the grey cement. They were the same stones from the beach near the village, the ones my mother had collected in her pail.

This was not just any foundation. This was her foundation. The one she had mixed, bucket by bucket, stone by chosen stone. The memory was not my own; it was implanted, a vivid seed from her story. *“You choose the stones for their smoothness,”* she had said, that last night in KL, her voice thin but clear. *“A rough stone will trap air. Air is the enemy. It makes weakness. A bubble becomes a crack. A crack becomes a collapse. You must choose stones that have already been shaped by a greater force. Then you bind them. You make their history your strength.”*

I placed my palm on the mossy concrete. It was cold and damp. But beneath the vegetable sponge, I could feel the aggregate, the stubborn, perfect smoothness of those river stones locked in their eternal embrace with cement. She hadn’t just built a foundation. She had curated one. She had taken the history of the river—its grinding, patient power—and embedded it into the spine of her own history.

The hook was silent now. It had found its home. It was not in me. It was in this wall. I was the one who was hooked.

A flash of white in the green. To the left of the foundation mound, half-concealed by a curtain of hanging *akar* roots, was a shape. Not concrete. Ceramic.

I pushed the roots aside. It was a broken *tong*, a large glazed pot, shattered into five large pieces. It lay on its side, a ceramic shell. Inside it was not dirt, but a carefully arranged nest of more recent detritus: a rusted Swiss Army knife, a plastic water bottle bleached by sun, a few foil wrappers, a cigarette lighter. A hide. A place for a worker, or a poacher, to rest. The intimacy of it, the mundane human use of this ancient, broken thing, was more startling than any artifact. Life had continued here. It had just become smaller, more transient.

I righted one of the ceramic shards. The glaze was a milky celadon, cracked into a fine web. It was the same colour as my mother’s urn.

The world did not spin. No ghost whispered. But the connection was a clean, hard line, like a surveyor’s transit sighting a benchmark. This pot had held water for the builders. It had been part of the effort. Now it was broken, a shelter for secrets and small rests. My mother’s ashes were in a pot of the same colour, on a shelf in a temporary flat in Butterworth. From holding water, to holding labour, to holding secrets, to holding dust. It was all just containment. The sacred was just a useful shape, until it broke and revealed its utility.

I left the broken *tong* and followed the line of the foundation. It curved, describing a large, round space. An open circle? A courtyard? The compass sketch showed a door in a hillside. This was not a hillside. This was a valley floor.

Then the land began to rise again, sharply. The foundation wall met a steep, laterite slope covered in thin, wiry trees. And there, at the junction of human intention and natural rise, was the arch.

It was not a door. Not yet. It was a promise of one.

Two pillars of concrete, each as wide as I was tall, rose from the end of the foundation mound to frame a recess in the hillside. They supported a heavy, curved lintel. The space within the frame was filled with a compacted mass of earth, roots, and fallen leaves—the hill itself, seamlessly swallowing the invitation. But the frame was unmistakable. It was the outline from the compass sketch, rendered in monumental scale. And on the inner faces of the pillars, carved into the concrete before it had set, were the symbols.

I brushed away the damp moss with my fingers. The concrete was pocked and weathered, but the carvings were deep. On the left pillar: a rubber seed, its wing detailed with fine lines. A grain of rice. A rambutan, its hairy shell rendered with careful spikes. On the right pillar: more. A durian bloom. A pepper vine. A tea leaf.

Seeds. All seeds. The beginning of things. The potential.

And at the centre of the lintel, above the sealed earth, was a circular depression. The keyhole.

I took the filed-down halfpenny from my pocket. It sat in my palm, a tiny, worn disc of empire, repurposed. It was too small. The depression in the lintel was the size of a saucer. This was not the key. This was a token. A reference point.

The draftsman’s words returned. *The story is yours to finish.*

He hadn’t given me a key. He had given me a bearing. The door was here. It was sealed by time and growth. The key was not a physical object. It was an action. A choice.

I looked from the sealed arch to the broken *tong* to the foundation with its smooth, chosen stones. My mother had built the foundation. She had chosen each stone for its history of being shaped by force. She had bound them to create a strength that outlasted her. The arch was the transition. The door was the threshold.

But what was on the other side?

The answer was in the seeds. Not in what they were, but in what they needed. A seed was a contract with the future. It required a specific combination of elements to fulfil its promise: soil, water, heat, time.

I walked back to the foundation wall. I ran my hand along it, looking for the weakness, the bubble, the crack. Her greatest fear. I found it near the ground, where a *senduduk* shrub had forced its way through. A fine, dark crack, hair-thin, ran up from the base. I pried at the edge of the concrete with the filed halfpenny. A small flake came away. Beneath it, the concrete was dry and sound. The crack was just surface. A scar, not a fault.

But it was an opening.

I dug. Not with my hands, but with the coin, scraping away the loose material, following the thin dark line. An inch in, the coin tip hit something that was not stone or cement. Something that gave a faint, metallic *tink*.

My heart was a slow, heavy drum. I cleared more away, breaking a fingernail, the skin of my knuckles grating against rough aggregate. There, embedded in the concrete, laid carefully in the mix before it set, was a small, sealed glass vial. Inside it, rolled tight, was a scroll of paper.

The past was not a place to visit. It was a structure to enter. And she had left a message in the walls.

I sat back on my heels, the vial cold and gritty in my palm. The green silence of the valley pressed in, watchful. This was the pause before the breath. This was the moment between the turning of the key and the click of the lock.

I did not open it. Not yet.

This was not a message for the jungle, or for the ghosts of builders. It was a message for the one who came looking for the bones of the land. For the one who understood that a foundation is built not to be seen, but to be built upon. It was for me.

I put the vial in my pocket, next to the compass. The two weights settled together, glass and brass. The hook was gone. In its place was a specific, located gravity. I had come to find a ghost and found, instead, a blueprint. I had come for answers and found the first question, preserved in glass.

The arch waited. The door was sealed. But the foundation had spoken. It had given up its first secret.

I looked up at the archway filled with earth. To finish the story, I would need to open the door. And to open the door, I would need to understand the seeds. I would need to become the specific combination of elements they required.

The sun was beginning to slant, painting the honeyed light with streaks of amber. The fifth mile, the last point two, would be the walk back out. But it would not be a retreat. It would be a return, armed with a new coordinate. I had a bearing. I had a foundation. I had a question in a vial.

I turned my back on the arch. The journey was no longer about carrying the question. It was about preparing to answer it. The compass needle pointed north, back towards the world of roads and cars and temporary flats holding celadon urns. But the true navigation now was internal, a map redrawn by the weight of a glass cylinder and the silent, patient architecture of a choice made fifty years ago.

As I walked into the gathering dusk, the first fireflies emerged in the valley behind me, their cold, intermittent lights flickering around the sealed arch like a silent, persistent code. They were not signs. They were simply what happened when the day surrendered to the dark—small, living points of orientation, mapping the space between one mystery and the next.

# Chapter 16

## **Chapter 16**

The temporary flat in Georgetown held the day’s heat like a lung holding breath. The air was thick, flavored with the distant fry of *char kway teow* and the closer, persistent damp of the old building’s plaster. My mother’s urn sat on the low teak table, a still center in the room’s stagnant whirl. The vial from the foundation lay beside it. Two containers. One held what remained of a life, reduced to mineral and memory. The other held a potential, a question suspended in amber liquid and dormant biology.

I had spent the walk out from the valley, the drive back to the city, in a state of suspended animation. The specific gravity in my pocket was a lodestone, pulling not at my body but at my attention. Every streetlamp, every passing face, every leaf on the angsana trees lining the road seemed to vibrate with a new frequency. I was seeing the world through the lens of the seeds. What combination of elements did they require? Not just soil and water. A person. A specific key.

The flat’s single bare bulb did little to push back the encroaching night. I filled a glass with tepid tap water and drank it standing by the sink, watching a gecko stalk a moth across the ceiling. The silence here was different from the jungle’s. It was a hollow silence, an absence waiting to be filled with traffic or television from another unit. It was a silence that made the hum of my own thoughts deafening.

I had come to Penang to bury my mother and, in doing so, to bury my own confusion. To lay a ghost. But the ghost had not been in the urn. The ghost was in the architecture of my grandfather’s choice, in the sealed arch, in this vial. He had not built a tomb. He had built a lock. And the seeds were the tumblers.

I sat on the thin mattress, the springs complaining. I took the vial from my pocket and held it up to the light. The seeds were dark, smaller than peppercorns, their surfaces dull and unremarkable. They looked less like life and more like debris, the kind of thing you would sweep from a corner and discard. Yet they had been placed with ritual, with intention, sealed behind glass and brick and earth. They were not meant to grow there. They were meant to be found. A test. A prerequisite.

*To open the door, I would need to understand the seeds. I would need to become the specific combination of elements they required.*

The thought was not a metaphor. It was a directive. It had the cold, clean logic of an engineering schematic. My grandfather was a builder. He thought in terms of load-bearing walls, of hydrological surveys, of materials and their properties. He would not have left a poetic riddle. He would have left a set of conditions. A chemical, historical, perhaps genealogical formula.

I needed to know what they were.

The obvious path was a botanist, a laboratory. But the instinct that had grown in me since finding the foundation—a slow, sure root of understanding—argued against it. This was not a scientific inquiry to be conducted under fluorescent lights. This was a familial one. The answer was not in a database; it was in the sediment of our own history. The combination of elements was personal. It was *me*. Or some aspect of me I had not yet accounted for.

I looked at the urn. “What did he talk about, when he talked about the land?” I asked the quiet ceramic. “What did he plant?”

She had hated his obsession with that plot. *A fool’s errand*, she called it. *Chasing a dream that died with the Japanese.* But in her irritation, there had been details. Shards of story I had collected as a child and stored away, not as memory, but as background noise. The way one remembers the pattern of a childhood wallpaper without ever having studied it.

I lay back, the vial clenched in my fist, and let the wallpaper of memory resolve.

***

*The monsoon rain was a solid curtain of water, hammering the roof of our house in KL. I was nine, or perhaps ten. The power was out. My mother had lit a kerosene lamp, its flame painting her face in liquid gold and shifting shadow. She was sorting old photographs, a rare moment of stillness. I was at her feet, piecing together a jigsaw puzzle of the Eiffel Tower, a place neither of us would ever see.*

*“Your grandfather,” she said, not to me, but to the photograph in her hand—a blurred snapshot of a serious man in front of a half-built wall. “He believed land had a memory. Not a sentimental memory. A practical one. Like… like the memory in a piece of bent wood. It holds the shape of the stress.”*

*I didn’t look up. “What’s it remember?”*

*“Who loved it. Who bled on it. Who broke it.” She put the photo down, picked up another. “He said the best foundation wasn’t cement. It was continuity. A thing growing in the same spot for a hundred years. A family. A trade. He said that kind of memory made the ground stable. It knew how to hold weight.”*

*“Is that why he bought the valley?”*

*She snorted. “He bought it because it was cheap. And because he was a stubborn man who saw a challenge in every empty space.” She tapped the photo. “He tried to plant an orchard there. Before the war. Not durian, not rambutan. Something useless. Something that wouldn’t sell.”*

*My puzzle piece clicked into place. “What kind?”*

*She was silent for a long moment, listening to the rain. The memory of her silence was precise. It was the silence of someone touching a bruise they’d forgotten they had.*

*“I don’t remember,” she said finally, and her voice had gone flat, a door closing. “Something that didn’t belong. He was always trying to grow things that didn’t belong.”*

*The subject was closed. She went back to her photos. I went back to my puzzle, the moment dissolving into the rhythm of the rain. But the shape of it remained. The bent wood. The memory in the land. The orchard of things that didn’t belong.*

***

I opened my eyes. The gecko had caught the moth. The flat was dark but for the jaundiced glow from the street below. *Something that didn’t belong.*

I got up, turned on my phone’s weak flashlight, and rummaged in my backpack for the folder of documents—the land title, the faded letters, the few official papers that had survived my mother’s periodic purges of the past. I spread them on the floor beside the mattress. The beam of light was a poor substitute for the kerosene lamp, but the act felt the same: an archaeology of paper.

Most of it was administrative sludge. But near the bottom, folded into quarters and brittle at the creases, was a single sheet of my grandfather’s drafting paper. It was not a building plan. It was a list, handwritten in his precise, architectural script. A column of Malay names, some with English approximations in parentheses. A plant inventory.

*Pokok Meranti* (Light Red Meranti). *Pokok Gaharu* (Agarwood). *Bunga Kantan* (Torch Ginger). *Pokok Cengal* (Neobalanocarpus). Timber trees, a fragrant tree, a flowering ginger. Sensible choices. Then, at the bottom, separated by a line:

*Dua (2) batang. Pokok Naga. Dari Batu Caves.*

Two saplings. Dragon Tree. From Batu Caves.

My breath stilled. *Pokok Naga*. It was a common name, applied to several plants. A type of yam. A variety of fern. But *from Batu Caves*? That was specific. That was a provenance. The Batu Caves were limestone karst formations north of Kuala Lumpur, a Hindu pilgrimage site, a place of deep, dripping geological time and devotion. They were not a nursery.

I ran a finger over the words. *Dari Batu Caves*. Not purchased. *From*. As in taken, collected, retrieved. As in a cutting or a seed gathered from a specific, sacred place. This was the useless thing. The thing that didn’t belong in a commercial orchard. It was a relic, not a crop.

I looked at the vial. Could these be the seeds of *Pokok Naga*? It was plausible, but it felt incomplete. A name was not the combination. It was a label. The combination was the *why*. Why this plant? Why from there? Why seal it away as a key?

The answer, I knew, would not be in a book. It would be in the place itself. In the memory of the land, and the memory of the stone from which the plant was taken.

I had to go to Batu Caves.

***

The bus north to Selangor was a different beast from the train. It was all shouted conversations, the tinny blast of action movies from overhead screens, the smell of sweat and packed *nasi lemak*. I carried only a small daypack. The urn stayed in the flat. The vial was in a small pouch around my neck, hidden under my shirt. It felt warmer there, against my skin, as if it were absorbing my pulse.

This was a detour. A digression from the central mystery of the valley. And yet, as the urban sprawl of Georgetown gave way to the industrial belts and then to the green swaths of oil palm plantations, it felt like the truest bearing I had taken. The compass needle might point north, but I was following a older line, drawn in my grandfather’s hand on a brittle piece of paper.

Batu Caves rose from the flat plain like the vertebrae of a buried giant. The limestone cliffs were sheer, streaked with the black filigree of water stains and time. The colossal golden statue of Lord Murugan gleamed in the harsh midday sun, a dazzling sentinel before the mouth of the main cave. The air vibrated with a different humidity here, cooler, carrying the scent of incense, bat guano, and crushed flowers from the offerings littering the steps.

I stood at the base of the 272 rainbow-colored steps, looking up at the dark maw of the Temple Cave. Pilgrims and tourists flowed around me, a river of humanity in bright clothes, moving with a collective, panting purpose. This was a place of public devotion. My grandfather, a pragmatic builder, a man who spoke of stresses and loads, was not a pilgrim. He would not have come for *puja*. He would have come as a surveyor. As a collector of materials.

I began to climb, the vial a gentle weight against my sternum. The steps were steep, each one a minor exertion. Halfway up, my thighs burning, I paused and looked back. The world spread out below, a tidy grid of roads and roofs. A planner’s view. This was the perspective he would have appreciated. The strategic value of high ground.

At the top, the cave opened into a vast, cathedral-like space. Light filtered down from openings high in the ceiling, illuminating the swirling, perpetual dusk. Shrines lined the walls, their statues watching with painted eyes. The chatter of the steps fell away, replaced by the echo of murmured prayers, the drip of water, the soft flutter of pigeons nesting in the high crevices. The air was cool enough to raise goosebumps on my arms.

I moved away from the main altars, towards the shadowed, less-traveled perimeter. My grandfather would have been interested in the boundaries, the points where the sacred space met the raw geology. I trailed my fingers along the limestone wall. It was porous, pocked with tiny holes and fossilized seams. Life clung to it: patches of moss, delicate ferns, thin, tenacious vines.

And then I saw it. In a high, narrow fissure, where a trickle of water seeped continuously down the rock face, a plant grew. It had thick, waxy leaves of a deep, resilient green, and a stem that was not quite a stem but a series of segmented, fleshy links, clinging to the stone with aerial roots. It was a *Dischidia*, a type of ant plant. But locally, it had another name. *Pokok Naga*. Dragon Tree. It was an epiphyte. It lived not on the land, but on the memory of the stone. It drew its sustenance from air, from water, from decay. It belonged precisely because it asked for no soil, no plot. It required only a vertical surface, patience, and damp shadow.

This was the thing that didn’t belong in an orchard. Because an orchard was horizontal, ordered, rooted in dirt. This was a vertical thing. A clinging thing. A thing that thrived on the interface between rock and air.

I stared at it, the pieces clicking together with the quiet, final sound of a well-made joint.

My grandfather hadn’t been planting an orchard for fruit. He had been building a living, vertical component. A biological part of the structure. The *Pokok Naga* wasn’t a crop. It was a *material*. Its properties were its tenacity, its ability to hold onto sheer surfaces, to stabilize, to green a wall. He had brought it from a sacred cave to his own sacred site. He had tried to integrate it. To use the memory of this stone to fortify the memory of his own land.

But the war had come. The project was abandoned. The plants had died, or been forgotten. All but the seeds. The essential, condensed potential. He had saved that. He had sealed it in glass and brick, not as a treasure, but as a specification. A reminder of the intended material. The lock required the original blueprint. The door required the original, intended component.

The combination of elements was not just me. It was me, plus the memory of the stone, plus the biological imperative of this specific, clinging life. I had to become the conduit for that memory. I had to understand the stone, so I could understand the seed, so I could become the key.

A priest in white robes walked past, ringing a small bell. The sound was clean and sharp in the cavernous space. I looked from the plant in the fissure to the vial beneath my shirt. I understood now what I held. It was not a mystery. It was a job. A builder’s instruction, left for the only apprentice who would ever care to look.

I descended the steps as the afternoon began to wane. The journey back to Georgetown was a blur. My mind was no longer in the bus; it was in the valley, at the sealed arch. I saw it not as a barrier, but as an uncompleted section. A wall waiting for its final, living layer.

***

The flat was as I had left it, but the silence now had a texture. It was the silence of a workshop before work begins. I placed the vial on the table once more, next to the urn. I addressed them both.

“He wasn’t building a monument,” I said, my voice too loud in the empty room. “He was building a *graft*.”

The concept was clear, surgical. He was grafting the memory of the sacred cave onto the memory of his own land. Using the *Pokok Naga* as the living suture. The arch was the incision point. The seeds were the graftwood. And I… I was the cambium layer. The living tissue that had to align for the graft to take, for the join to be successful, for the flow of meaning to be restored.

It was a terrifying responsibility. It was no longer about uncovering a secret. It was about performing a surgery on history. About becoming an active, necessary ingredient in a recipe fifty years cold.

I could not do it with knowledge alone. I needed the substance. I needed to connect with the memory of the stone from which the seeds came. I needed to bring that memory back to the valley. Not as a pilgrim, but as a bearer. A translator of materials.

The next morning, I went to the wet market. I bought a small lump of beeswax, a square of plain white cotton, a spool of jute twine. I took the bus back to Batu Caves. I did not climb to the Temple Cave. Instead, I went to the quieter, darker Cave of the Art Gallery. There, away from the crowds, I found a section of the limestone wall that was dry, textured with the imprints of ancient shells.

I warmed the beeswax in my hands until it was pliable. I pressed it firmly into a patch of the stone, pushing it into the pores, the cracks, the fossilized curves. I held it there, my palm flat, for a long count of one hundred. I was not taking a photograph. I was taking an impression. A physical record of the stone’s memory, its specific topography.

I peeled the wax away. It held the perfect, negative image of the limestone—every pore, every ripple, every minute signature of time. I wrapped the wax carefully in the cotton, then bound it with the jute. A humble, physical token. A builder’s sample.

On the bus back to Penang, with the wax impression in my lap, I felt the final piece of the combination settle into place. It was not enough to have the seeds. It was not enough to have the understanding. I needed the literal impression of the source. I needed to carry the shape of the memory with me.

The combination was now complete: The seeds (the biological imperative). The understanding (the architectural intent). The impression (the physical memory of the source). And the bearer (me, the lineage, the living bridge).

When I returned to the flat, dusk was again gathering. I did not turn on the light. I sat on the floor, the urn, the vial, and the wax packet before me. The three objects formed a triangle on the teak.

I had my answer. I had my combination of elements.

To open the door, I would not need to break it. I would need to complete the wall. I would need to plant the graft. I would need to press the memory of the cave against the memory of the foundation and bind them with the living thread of the seeds and my own will.

It was a quiet, monumental realization. It carried no fanfare. It was simply the next step in the construction process.

I picked up the vial. The seeds were no longer dormant questions. They were specific, calibrated tools. I looked at the urn. “I’m going to finish his wall,” I said.

There was no reply. There was only the deepening blue of the evening at the window, and the certain, steady weight of the task in my hand.

The hook was gone. In its place was a procedure. A method. I knew what had to be done. The final preparation was not research. It was ritual. The ritual of a builder. The gathering of tools, the review of the plan, the mental rehearsal of the sequence.

I would need to return to the valley at the right time. At a time of grafting. At dawn, perhaps, when the sap was rising. I would need to prepare the site at the arch, to clear the earth not to dig, but to expose the intended planting site. I would need the wax impression, the seeds, water from the stream, and a trowel. And I would need to say the right words. Not an incantation, but a statement of intent. A builder’s dedication, spoken to the foundation.

I knew all this with a calm, procedural clarity. The romance of the mystery had burned away, leaving the clean, hard lines of the task.

I packed my bag for the morning. Trowel. Water bottle. Twine. The wax impression. The vial. The compass.

I lay down on the mattress, but I did not sleep. I rehearsed the steps in my mind. I visualized the arch, the texture of the earth, the angle of the morning sun. I felt the cool glass of the vial, the crumble of the wax, the give of the soil. I heard the words I would say, simple and direct. *For the foundation. For the graft. For the memory.*

It was near midnight when the quiet of the flat was broken. Not by a sound from the street, but by a sensation. A subtle, vibrational shift, like a single string on a distant instrument being plucked.

I sat up.

The celadon urn on the table was glowing. A faint, phosphorescent green, the color of cave moss, of deep forest shade. It was not a light cast upon it. It was a light emanating from within the ceramic itself, seeping through the glaze, illuminating the simple, elegant curves.

I did not move. I watched.

The glow pulsed, once, twice, a slow, rhythmic beat. Then it began to intensify, not spreading, but concentrating. It pooled, gathered, and then—with a sound like a sigh, like the release of a long-held breath—a thin, wraith-like tendril of the same green light seeped from the urn’s sealed lid. It drifted, weightless, across the space between the table and where I sat.

It did not feel like a ghost. It did not feel like my mother. It felt like an emission. A release of stored energy. A final discharge.

The tendril of light hovered before me for a moment, a luminous, question mark. Then it moved, not towards me, but towards my packed bag on the floor. It descended, and with impossible delicacy, it touched the side pocket where the wax impression lay wrapped in cotton.

The light soaked into the fabric, was absorbed, and vanished.

The glow from the urn faded, dying back to the dull, matte green of ordinary ceramic. The flat was dark again, and silent.

My heart was a slow, heavy drum in the quiet.

She had not given me a sign when I had begged for one on the train. She had given it now, when I no longer needed a sign, but a confirmation. She had given the last of her substance—the mineral memory, the ashes, the *abu*—not to the land, but to the memory of the stone. She had completed the circuit. She had added her memory to the combination.

The elements were now four: The seeds. The understanding. The impression. The ashes.

I was no longer just the bearer. I was the site. The place where all lines converged.

I looked at the dark urn, then at my bag. The procedure was no longer just a construction. It was a confluence. A layering of histories, one upon the other, until the weight of them, the specific gravity of them, would be enough to turn the lock.

I lay back down. The hook for the next chapter was not a question. It was a threshold.

I had everything I needed. At dawn, I would go to finish building the wall.

# Chapter 17

## **Chapter 17**

The flat was a vessel of spent potential. The air felt thin, scraped clean by the passage of the light. I did not sleep. I lay on the mattress, my eyes tracing the water stain on the ceiling, its shape a familiar, meaningless continent. The urn was inert. A pot. My bag on the floor was just a bag. The objects had performed their function, and now they were objects again, heavier with implication but lighter in essence. The transaction was complete.

At first light, I rose. My body moved with a procedural calm. I boiled water on the single gas ring, poured it over the coarse grounds in the metal *sock*, watched the dark bloom. The coffee tasted of tin and bitterness. I drank it looking out the window at the back alley, at the moss-slicked wall and the pile of broken bricks. A ginger cat picked its way through the debris with fastidious disdain. The world was insistently mundane. It was a relief.

I packed with methodical care. The seeds, in their old tobacco tin, went into the left pocket of my canvas satchel. The wax impression, still wrapped in its cotton shroud, now humming with a charge I could not feel but knew was there, went into the right. The urn I left on the table. It was empty of everything but form. Let the landlord deal with it. My mother was not in there. She was in the combination.

I shrugged the satchel onto my shoulder. The weight was correct. Necessary. I did not look back at the room. It had been a waystation, a chamber for catalysis. Its purpose was fulfilled.

The morning air in George Town was a damp cloth pressed to the skin. The scent of frangipani from a hidden garden warred with the greasy aroma of *nasi lemak* from a street cart. I walked. My destination was not the clan jetty, not yet. There was a final purchase to make.

The hardware shop on Armenian Street was a cave of shadows and dust. Metal buckets hung from the ceiling like galley bells. Rows of nails, sorted by size, gleamed dully in glass jars. An old Chinese man in a singlet sat on a stool by the counter, peeling a pomelo with a paring knife. The white pith fell in long, curling ribbons onto a sheet of newspaper.

“*Mau cari apa?*” he asked, not looking up. What are you looking for?

“Mortar,” I said. “A small amount. And a trowel.”

He gestured with his chin towards the back, the knife still moving. “Sack in the corner. Ten-kilo. Trowels on the wall.”

I found the sack of cement mix, shouldered it. Its grit leaked through the burlap onto my shirt. I chose a small, pointed trowel, its blade worn silver at the edges from long use. At the counter, he weighed the sack on a brass scale, its counterweights clinking.

“Project,” he stated, wrapping the trowel in brown paper.

“A repair,” I said.

He nodded, as if repairs were the only true purpose for mortar. He took my money, his fingers dry as paper. As I turned to leave, he spoke again, his eyes on his pomelo. “Repair old things, use a little palm sugar in the mix. Makes it stick to the old lime. Holds the memory of the wall.”

I stopped. “Palm sugar?”

“*Gula melaka*,” he said, finally looking at me. His eyes were the colour of weak tea. “Old way. The sugar breathes. Lets the wall move. Pure cement…” He made a cracking sound with his tongue against his teeth. “Shatters. Too proud.”

I stood there, the sack a dead weight on my shoulder. It was a piece of craft. A nuance. The procedure demanded specificity, and here was specificity offered from the dusty air of a hardware shop. I had not asked for it. It had been given.

“Where do I get it?”

He pointed the tip of his knife down the street. “Indian shop. They have the blocks.”

I bought a small, dark cone of *gula melaka* from a woman who sold lentils and spices from giant sacks. It smelled of caramel and smoke. She wrapped it in a banana leaf, tied it with string. Now my satchel held the four elements, and my physical burden held the means of their fusion: the cement, the trowel, the sugar. The weight was asymmetrical, one side metaphysical, the other crude and physical. I walked towards the sea, balancing both.

The clan jetty was quiet in the mid-morning lull. The tourists would come later, with their hats and their phones, to take pictures of the wooden houses on stilts, to buy overpriced trinkets. Now, there was only the lap of oily water against the pilings, the creak of wood, the distant putter of a fishing boat. I walked past the inhabited houses, past lines of drying laundry and potted chilli plants, to the far end where the structure grew derelict, where the planks were soft with rot and some houses stood empty, their windows boarded.

The shed was as I remembered it. A forgotten tooth at the end of the jetty. Its door, warped by salt and sun, was secured with a rusted padlock that had not been touched in years. I did not need the door.

I set my burdens down on the weathered planks. The water beneath was a slick, dark green. I knelt at the side of the jetty, beside the shed’s outer wall. The repair was visible—a newer patch of bricks, roughly two feet square, set into the older, crumbling brickwork. The mortar was grey and modern, already cracking at the edges, rejecting the embrace of the original wall. It was a clumsy job. A temporary fix. The memory of the wall had rejected it.

This was the place. The site of the old furnace. The site of the theft. The site where the safe had been sealed away by a man who understood stone and silence.

I opened the sack of cement mix, poured a mound onto a piece of scrap plywood I found stacked nearby. I used a discarded coconut shell to scoop water from the sea. The water was warm, brackish. I mixed it into the powder with the trowel, working it into a thick, grey paste. Then I unwrapped the cone of palm sugar. I shaved off curls of the dark, fragrant block with the trowel’s edge, folding them into the mortar. The mixture darkened, took on a faint, molasses smell. It became less like paste, more like clay.

My movements were slow, deliberate. A ritual of making. This was not construction. It was integration. I was using the sugar to let the wall breathe, to let the new layer accept the weight of the old. To let it hold memory.

With the edge of the trowel, I began to scrape out the failing modern mortar. It came away in gritty crumbs, falling between the planks into the water below with soft *plinks*. The old bricks beneath were revealed, their faces pocked and scarred from the heat of the furnace they had once contained. I cleared the joints until they were deep and clean.

Then, I began to lay the new mix.

The first trowel-full was a commitment. I pressed the dark mortar into the vertical joint between two bricks, smoothing it with the tip of the blade. It did not just fill the gap; it seemed to settle, to seep into the pores of the old brick. I worked steadily, left to right, bottom to top. The world narrowed to the square of wall, to the feel of the trowel in my hand, the gritty resistance of the mix, the smell of wet cement and caramel.

I was halfway done when I heard the footsteps on the planks behind me. They were slow, unhurried. I did not turn. I continued smoothing a joint.

The footsteps stopped. I felt a presence at my shoulder. A shadow fell across my work.

“You are early.”

It was Mr. Wong’s voice. It held no surprise. Only a weary observation.

I finished the joint, wiped the trowel blade clean on the plywood. “The work required an early start.”

He moved to stand beside me, looking down at my repair. He wore the same grey trousers, a different but equally faded shirt. His hands were clasped behind his back. He observed the mortar, the palm sugar mix, the careful excavation.

“You use the old method.”

“I was advised it holds memory better.”

A faint, dry sound escaped him. It might have been a laugh. “Memory is a tenant. It must be offered a house that will not collapse.” He was silent for a long moment. The water lapped. “You have it all, then. The combination.”

It was not a question. I nodded, still looking at the wall. “I have it.”

“And the ashes?”

“They are part of it.”

He absorbed this. “So. It is a confluence. Not just a key.” He shifted his weight. “This changes the weight of the thing. You understand? It is no longer just opening a lock. It is asking the lock to recognise a lineage. To accept an inheritance.”

“I understand.”

“Do you?” He turned his head to look at me directly. His eyes were like the mortar—grey, holding fragments of harder things. “The safe was sealed with a specific intent. To hide. To preserve. To keep a secret from the light. You are not asking it to open for the original purpose. You are asking it to open for a consequence. The lock may reject the consequence. Or the consequence may be more than you are prepared to hold.”

I picked up the trowel again, dipped it into the mortar. “I am not preparing to hold it. I am preparing to see it.”

He watched me press the mix into the next joint. His silence was a form of concession.

“I will be here,” he said finally. “When you finish the wall. The jetty is not empty. Eyes are on the water, on the houses. But here, at this end, there is a kind of privacy. I will ensure it remains.”

It was an offer of guardianship. Not help, but witness. I nodded again, my throat tight. “Thank you.”

He did not reply. His footsteps receded back down the jetty, softer than they had arrived. I was alone again with the wall, with the elements in my bag, with the procedure that was now a confluence.

I worked until the square was filled. The new mortar, dark with its sugar, sat snug in the joints. It did not look new. It looked like a healed scar, tissue that had grown to match the surrounding skin. I cleaned the trowel in the sea water, wiped it dry, laid it on the plywood. The physical work was done.

Now came the layering.

The sun was high, hot on the back of my neck. I sat cross-legged before the repaired wall. From my satchel, I took the four elements, placing them on the planks before me.

The tobacco tin of seeds.
My own understanding—a quiet, cold certainty in my chest.
The cotton-wrapped wax impression.
And the memory of the ashes, the *abu*, now transferred, now part of the impression.

I did not speak. Incantation was for those who needed to convince the air. I simply began.

I opened the tobacco tin. The seeds lay within, tiny and hard, like fossilised tears. I took one. I pressed it into the soft, still-damp mortar at the centre of the repaired square. I pressed another a few inches to the left. Another to the right. I placed them not in a pattern, but as they fell from my fingers, a random constellation pressed into the dark grey field. Each press was an application of the first element: the origin, the stolen potential, the life that was meant to grow.

That was the first layer.

I sat back. I closed my eyes. I brought forward my understanding. Not the emotional weight—the grief, the confusion, the anger—but the cold, architectural knowledge of what had happened. My grandfather’s theft. His flight. The sealing of the safe. My mother’s lifelong burden of his silence. My own journey to this jetty. I built the structure of it in my mind, clean and spare, like a blueprint. I directed that understanding towards the wall, towards the seeds embedded in the mortar. I imprinted the logic of the consequence onto the physical site. The second layer.

I unwrapped the wax impression. The green light that had seeped into it was invisible. It was just a lump of wax with a detailed negative of the lock’s face. But it felt warm, or perhaps my fingers were cold. I held it in both hands. This was the third element: the shape of the obstacle, the physical memory of the mechanism. And within it now, woven into its substance, was the fourth: the ashes. Her mineral residue. Her final, granular witness.

I did not press the wax into the wall. That would have been meaningless. Instead, I leaned forward and held it against the mortar, over the constellation of seeds. I held it there, my arms trembling slightly with the strain of stillness. I was not applying it. I was presenting it. Offering the completed circuit to the site.

For a long time, nothing happened. There was just the sun, the water, the smell of my own sweat and the drying mortar. A bead of perspiration traced a path down my spine.

Then, a subtlety.

The dark, sugar-mortar around the embedded seeds began to change. Not in colour, but in texture. It lost its wet sheen, curing in moments, but curing into something that was not brittle. It looked porous, like pumice. The seeds seemed not to be stuck on the surface, but to be *emerging* from it, as if the wall was slowly extruding them.

The wax in my hands grew warm. Not unpleasantly so, but distinctly, consistently warm, like skin. The detail of the impression seemed to deepen, the lines of the lock’s design becoming sharper, more defined against the light.

I felt it then. A pressure. Not in my ears, but in the space around me, in the air between my body and the wall. It was a dense, silent hum, a sub-audible vibration that made my teeth ache faintly. The world did not dissolve. It became intensely, hyper-real. The grain of the wood beneath me, the rust stain on a nailhead, the individual fibres in the canvas of my satchel—all seemed etched with a terrible clarity.

The confluence was achieving its specific gravity.

I removed the wax from the wall. The mortar had dried completely around the seeds. The repair was no longer a repair. It was a tablet. A seal within a seal.

I had built the wall. The layering was complete.

I gathered my things, my movements slow, deliberate against the heavy air. I put the wax impression back in its cotton, into the satchel. I put the tin of remaining seeds away. I stood up, my knees cracking. I looked at the wall.

It was just a wall again. But the square of mortar held a quiet, settled power. It was done.

I walked back down the jetty. The tourists had arrived. I moved through them like a ghost, unseen. My body was tired, but my mind was preternaturally clear. The hook for the next chapter was not a question of readiness. It was a question of alignment.

I had built the wall that contained the confluence. The next step was to present that confluence to the lock it was designed for. The procedure was no longer a theory, a gathering of parts. It was a poised fact.

I had everything I needed. The elements were merged, their weight pressing against the fabric of this place. I would not go to the safe today. The confluence needed to settle, to bond fully with the site. The wall needed to finish breathing.

But tomorrow, at the same hour, I would return. I would not come to build. I would come to ask.

The threshold was not ahead of me. I was standing on it. The air itself felt braced, waiting for the turn of the key.

# Chapter 18

## **Chapter 18**

The clarity held through the night. It was a cold, mineral thing, like the air after a lightning strike. I slept without dreaming, a black and weightless suspension, and woke with the same preternatural focus. The procedure was a poised fact. The wall was breathing. I was the fulcrum.

I dressed with the same deliberate care I had used to mix the mortar. Cotton trousers, a faded shirt, the canvas satchel containing the wax impression, the tin, the empty cotton pouch. Tools were no longer required. I was not a builder today. I was a petitioner.

The morning was a duplicate of the last. The same bruised dawn, the same damp hush over the water, the same empty jetty before the tourist tide. The world felt rehearsed, waiting for its cue. I walked the same path, my footsteps sounding hollow on the planks, a metronome counting down to alignment.

I stopped before the wall. The square of mortar was no longer new. It had aged a century overnight. The colour had deepened, marrying with the older plaster. The embedded seeds were invisible now, swallowed by the matrix, but I could feel them. A low, patient pulse, the specific gravity of the confluence holding steady. It was ready.

I turned from the wall. The safe house was a ten-minute walk through waking streets. The smell of frying *roti canai* and diesel exhaust began to layer the air. I moved through it, detached. A man hosing down a tiled floor nodded at me. A motorbike sputtered past. Normalcy was a thin film over everything, and I was a needle poised to puncture it.

The shophouse was as I had left it. The heavy padlock on the grille, the dust-scented gloom within. I unlocked it, stepped inside, relocked it behind me. The ritual of security was meaningless now, but habit was a kind of gravity too. I climbed the stairs to the room that was not a room, the space where the safe lived in the wall.

The light from the single window fell in a familiar parallelogram on the floor. The safe door was a dark, blank eye in the plaster. I did not approach it immediately. I sat on the floorboards, cross-legged, placing the satchel before me. I took out the wax impression, still swaddled in its cotton. I unfolded the cloth. The wax disc lay there, the surface capturing the dim light, the intricate negative of the lock’s face gleaming in soft relief.

This was the ask. The confluence in the wall by the jetty was the answer to a question this lock had posed seventy years ago. My grandfather had heard the question. I had, I believed, crafted the reply. Now I had to present it.

The pressure from last evening returned, not as a vibration in the air, but as a density in my chest. The hyper-clarity sharpened further. I could see every whorl in the wax, every fleck of dust caught in its surface. My own breathing was a distant tide.

I stood. The floorboard creaked, a sound like a bone shifting. I took three steps to the safe. I held the wax disc between my thumb and forefinger. It was cool, slightly pliant. I raised it. I aligned it with the dark metal circle of the lock.

And paused.

The hook from last chapter was not a question of readiness. It was alignment. But as my hand hovered, a millimetre from contact, a fissure opened in my certainty. Alignment with what? The lock’s mechanism? Or with the intent behind it? I had been so focused on the craft, on the layering, on the physical *making* of the key. I had built a wall to contain a power. I had not asked what the power was for.

My grandfather’s journal had been a manual of *how*. It was silent on the *why*. The why was a ghost in the margins. A sense of duty, of preservation. A fear. But fear of what? What was so terrible it required a lock that could only be opened by a confluence grown into a wall?

The thought was a drop of ink in clear water. It bloomed, clouding the mineral clarity.

I pushed it down. The procedure was a fact. The wall was breathing. I was the fulcrum.

I pressed the wax disc against the lock.

It was not a key entering a keyhole. It was a seal meeting its mould. There was no click, no grind of tumblers. There was a sigh. A release of breath held for decades. The wax seemed to warm, then grow cool again. It adhered to the metal, not stuck, but held in place by a perfect, negative pressure.

I took my fingers away. The wax remained, a pale cataract over the lock’s dark pupil.

Nothing else happened.

I waited. The dust motes danced in the window light. A bicycle bell trilled faintly from the street. The safe door did not swing open. The world did not change.

A cold thread of doubt slipped down my spine. Had I misaligned it? Was the confluence not settled? I leaned closer, my nose almost touching the cold metal. I examined the seam where the wax met the lock. It was flawless. A perfect join.

Perhaps it needed time. Like the mortar. Perhaps the ask had to be absorbed.

I retreated to the centre of the room and sat again. I would wait. The procedure was a fact. I repeated it to myself, a mantra against the rising chill. I watched the safe door. It watched back, blind and indifferent.

An hour passed. The parallelogram of light slid across the floor, climbed the opposite wall. The wax seal did not change. The safe did not open.

The poised fact began to curdle. The fulcrum began to feel like a delusion.

I stood, my joints stiff. I approached the safe again. I reached out, meaning to peel the wax away, to check its impression, to start the diagnosis of my failure. My fingertips brushed the wax.

And the world dissolved.

Not into a Monet smear of exhaustion, but into a flash of pure, white noise. A silent detonation behind my eyes.

***

I was on the floor. I did not remember falling. My cheek was against the gritty wood. A thin line of droble connected my lip to the floor. I pushed myself up, my head ringing with a profound absence of sound. The room was the same. The light was the same. The wax was on the lock.

But something was different.

It was the dust. I knew, with a sickening certainty, the precise pattern of dust on the floorboards by the window. I knew the three nails near the baseboard were arranged in a shallow arc. I knew the water stain on the ceiling had the shape of a terrapin. I had not known these things a moment ago. Now, I knew them as if I had studied them for years.

I got to my feet, swaying. The knowledge was not just visual. It was somatic. I knew the ache in the third floorboard from the wall, a knot of tension in the wood. I knew the dry thirst of the plaster. I knew the slow, granular fatigue of the brick behind it.

I was not just in the room. The room was in me.

I stumbled to the window, gripping the sill for balance. The street below was wrong. The man selling newspapers was not just a man; he was a constellation of familiar aches—a twinge in the right knee from a childhood fall, a chronic stiffness between the shoulder blades from years of hunching over a sewing machine. I knew this. I *felt* it. The motorbike parked by the drain was not a vehicle; it was a repository of recent memories—a frantic ride in the rain two nights ago, the smell of the rider’s girlfriend’s perfume on the seat, a faint anxiety about a loan payment.

I jerked back from the window, my heart hammering against my ribs. This was not hyper-clarity. This was an invasion.

I looked at my hands. They were my hands. But the memory in them was not all mine. The callus on my right forefinger was from holding a trowel, yes, but also from the repetitive drag of a tailor’s needle. The faint scar across my left palm was from a broken bottle when I was twelve, but layered over it was the phantom pain of a burn from a soldering iron, from a time before I was born.

*Memory identity.*

The lens of the chapter. It was not a theme to be explored. It was a trapdoor that had just sprung open beneath me.

The confluence. I had not built a key to a lock. I had built a siphon. A conduit. The wall by the jetty wasn’t a container. It was a filter, a grounding point for something that flowed through this place. And by pressing the wax—the negative, the ask—against the lock, I had not opened a door. I had completed a circuit.

With me as the conductor.

The procedure was a fact. I had been right. And I had been catastrophically wrong.

I had to get out. I had to break the connection. I lurched towards the safe, towards the wax seal. I had to remove it. My hand, trembling, reached out.

Before I could touch it, the memories surged.

Not as images. As lived experience. They bypassed my eyes and flooded my nerves.

***

*I am a boy, seven or eight, squatting in the dust behind this shophouse. The year is 1953. The air smells of jasmine and charcoal. I am playing with a spinning top, its hum a steady buzz against my palm. My mother calls from upstairs. Her voice is sharp with a worry I do not understand. I ignore her. The top wobbles, dies. I feel a profound, childish disappointment, grey and heavy as clay. It is my disappointment. It is not mine.*

***

*I am a young woman, pressing a steamed bun into the hands of a man in a ragged uniform. 1945. His fingers are shockingly cold. He does not look at me. He whispers a word in a language I do not know. His shame is a taste like copper in my mouth. It is my mouth. It is not mine.*

***

*I am an old man, my grandfather, sitting at a wooden table in this room. The safe is open on the wall. He is not looking at its contents. He is looking at a small, faded photograph of a woman with severe eyes. His grief is not a feeling. It is a physical cavity in his chest, a hollow where a organ should be. He closes the safe. He turns the mechanism with a final, grinding effort. The decision he makes is absolute. It is a stone dropped into a well. I feel the stone hit the bottom. It is my grief. It is not mine.*

***

I was on my knees, vomiting a thin, clear bile onto the floorboards. The memories receded, leaving behind their residue—the taste of copper, the weight of clay, the hollow ache. They were embedded in me now, foreign bodies in my tissue.

This was the deeper truth. The false victory.

I had thought the confluence was a tool. A crafted thing to be used. But it was the opposite. It was a living record. The lock wasn’t keeping something out. It was keeping something *in*. The memories of this place. The psychic sediment of every fear, every hope, every mundane agony and joy that had seeped into these bricks and this soil and this water since the first jetty pile was driven.

My grandfather hadn’t built a lock to protect a secret. He had built a lock to contain a haunting. A cumulative, ambient haunting of pure *experience*. The confluence in the wall was a lightning rod, designed to attract and earth that energy, to give it a stable, physical form. The wax impression was the final trigger. The key didn’t open the safe. It opened *me*.

I was the safe now.

The thought was a horror so complete it was almost peaceful. I crawled away from the safe, from the wax seal. Breaking the physical connection changed nothing. The circuit was closed. The memories were not flowing into me; they were being revealed as already part of me. The distinction between my identity and the identity of this place was dissolving, like mortar in water.

I fumbled with the satchel. My hands, slick with sweat, felt alien. Were these the hands that had mixed the mortar? Or the hands that had turned the lock in 1947? Both. Neither. I pulled out my grandfather’s journal. I tore through the pages, not looking for instructions on layering or seed treatments. I was looking for a warning. A confession.

Near the back, on a page stained with what might have been tea, I found it. Not a procedure. A prayer.

*“The weight is not in the thing, but in the knowing. The lock does not hold the object. It holds the silence around it. To ask is to agree to carry the silence. To make the key is to become the lock. God forgive me. I cannot carry it. I build a vessel to carry it for me. May it be strong. May it be willing. May it never know what it holds.”*

He had not been writing about me. He had been writing about the confluence itself. The wall. The vessel. But I had not just built the vessel. I had *presented* it. I had pressed the ask against the lock. I had volunteered.

*May it be willing.*

I had been so willing. So clever. So precise.

I laughed, a raw, scraping sound in the quiet room. The vessel was strong. It was breathing. And it knew. It knew everything.

The hook from the previous chapter had been a lie. The threshold was not ahead of me. I had been standing on it, yes. But it was not a doorway. It was the edge of a dissolution. The key had turned. And it had turned *me*.

I gathered my things, movements clumsy, puppet-like. I had to get to the wall. It was the anchor, the physical locus of the confluence. If it was the filter, the grounding point, perhaps I could… what? Reverse the flow? Break the circuit? I had no theory left. Only a desperate, animal need to go to the last place where I had felt control.

I unlocked the grille door and stumbled into the street. The noon sun was a physical blow. The world assaulted me.

Every person was a walking wound of memory. A passing woman carried the visceral, crushing boredom of her factory job, the phantom itch of the uniform at her neck. A child on a tricycle radiated the sharp, bright terror of a recent nightmare about a tiger under the bed. An old man on a bench exuded a deep, lonely nostalgia for the smell of a particular river that had been paved over forty years ago. It was all naked, unmediated. I was not empathizing. I was *experiencing*. Their memories overwrote my own, not erasing them, but burying them under an avalanche of other lives.

I walked, head down, a ghost no longer unseen but overfull, a bloated receptacle. The jetty was crowded now. Tourists laughed, pointed at the fishing boats, posed for photographs. Their memories were simpler, more transient—annoyance at the heat, anticipation of lunch, a flicker of marital discontent, a fleeting awe at the colour of the water. They were lighter, but their volume was a torrent. I pushed through them, gasping.

My wall. There it was. The square of mortar looked innocent. Just a patch of repair. But I could feel it now, a low, steady thrum in the world, a heartbeat. It was not just containing the confluence. It was radiating it. And I was the receiving dish.

I stood before it, my satchel hanging heavy from my shoulder. The false victory was complete. I had built the wall that contained the power. I had become the lock that the power was meant for. I had achieved perfect, catastrophic alignment.

What was the procedure now? There was no next step in the journal. The final step was the carrying. The endless carrying.

I placed my hand flat against the mortar. It was warm, not from the sun, but from the slow, churning energy within. I expected another flood of memories, this time from the earth itself, from the water, from the old wood of the jetty.

Instead, I got a single, clear transmission. Not a memory of the past. A perception of the present. But not my own.

It was the perception of the wall.

I felt the pressure of my own hand from the *wall’s* perspective. The weight of my desperation. The chaotic, screaming tapestry of my stolen memories. I felt the wall’s purpose—to hold, to filter, to stabilise this endless broadcast of being. And I felt its… limitation. It was a filter, not a consciousness. It could receive and ground, but it could not *interpret*. It could not suffer.

That was my role. The vessel’s role. To suffer the knowing.

But in that moment of connection, a terrible understanding crystallized. The wall and I were now one system. The confluence flowed from the place, into the wall, through the circuit I had completed, and into me. I was the final component. The living lock.

And a lock can be broken.

The thought was not mine. It was the wall’s simple, functional logic reflected back at me. If the circuit was broken, the flow would stop. The memories would remain in the place, diffuse, ambient, as they had been for decades. The wall would be just mortar and seeds. The safe would remain shut. And I would be… what? A man riddled with foreign memories, a broken key.

But I would be a *separate* man.

It was the only way out of the false victory. Not to use the key, but to break it. To shatter the vessel.

I looked at my hand on the wall. The conduit. I closed my eyes. I did not know how to break a metaphysical circuit. But I knew the components. The wall. The wax seal. Myself.

I could destroy the wall. Chip out the mortar. Scatter the seeds. It would be a violence, a violation of my own craft. It might rupture something fundamental. It might not work.

Or I could destroy the wax. Return to the safe, peel it from the lock, melt it into oblivion. Sever the connection at the point of ask.

Or.

I could destroy the conductor.

The afternoon crowd swirled around me, oblivious to the man having a silent crisis of existence against a patch of wall. Their collective memories lapped at me—a desire for a cold drink, a worry about a missed call, a secret pleasure in a stolen glance. They were a cacophony. I could not think inside it.

I took my hand from the wall. The immediate, overwhelming flood from the people around me receded slightly, leaving me with the permanent, underlying hum of the place—the old, deep memories now woven into my own nervous system. The soldier’s shame. The boy’s disappointment. My grandfather’s stony grief.

I had to get away from the crowd. I needed silence, or the closest approximation I could get.

I walked off the jetty, away from the waterfront, into the narrower, residential lanes. The memories here were older, slower—generational patience, resigned poverty, the quiet pride of a clean doorstep. They were easier to bear, only because they were less frantic. They were a weight, not a stabbing.

I found myself outside a small, non-descript Chinese temple, its red paint faded to pink. It was empty. I stepped inside. The air was cool, thick with the smell of old incense and dust. The memories here were different again—not personal, but collective. A hum of repeated ritual, of whispered hopes, of a thousand small, identical fears offered up to indifferent gods. It was a blanket of white noise. For the first time since pressing the wax to the lock, I could hear my own thoughts.

The three options lay before me, stark and impossible.

Destroy the wall. Destroy the wax. Destroy myself.

The first was an act of vandalism against my own work, against the last intact thing my grandfather had designed. It felt like killing a child. Our child.

The second meant returning to the safe house, to the epicentre of the circuit. The thought of touching that wax again, of feeling that connection re-establish, made my stomach clench. What if removing it did nothing? What if it triggered something worse?

The third was a finality I could not yet shape into a real thought. It was a dark, quiet door at the end of a corridor.

I sat on a wooden bench, my head in my hands. The false victory was not that I had failed. It was that I had succeeded perfectly, and in doing so, had understood nothing. I had been obsessed with the *how* of memory—the craft of preserving it, layering it, giving it form. I had never considered the *what*. Memory is not a tool. It is an identity. And when you open yourself to the memory of a place, you invite every identity that place has ever held to take root in you. You become a tenement. A crowded, screaming tenement.

My grandfather had known. He had built the lock not to hide a treasure, but to quarantine a disease. The disease of too much knowing. And he had built the confluence as a potential cure—a controlled, grounded repository. But a cure requires a patient. A vessel.

He had not been able to bear it. So he had left the cure, and the disease, and the instructions for a braver, more foolish descendant to discover.

The hook for the next chapter was no longer about alignment or procedure. It was about surgery. How do you cut out a part of your own mind? How do you dismantle a truth you have worked for months to build?

The air in the temple did not feel braced. It felt exhausted. As exhausted as I was. The threshold I was standing on now was of a different kind. It was the threshold of a terrible choice.

I had built the wall. I had become the lock. And now, to survive, I would have to break one of them.

I lifted my head. The statue of the deity gazed back, its painted eyes eternally mid-blink. It held the silence of centuries. It did not suffer. It simply was.

I envied it with every stolen memory in my soul.

The choice was mine. But to make it, I needed to understand the exact nature of the bond. I needed to go back to the beginning. Not to the safe. To the journal. To the one memory I had avoided, the one identity I had refused to fully consider: my grandfather’s. Not his grief or his duty, but his moment of decision. The moment he chose to build the lock, and in doing so, chose to pass this curse to me.

I stood up. The collective ritual-memory of the temple clung to me like cobwebs. I walked back out into the lane, into the slow, deep memories of the houses. I turned my feet not towards the jetty, nor towards the safe house, but towards the cheap hotel room that held my few belongings and my grandfather’s final, unanswered question.

The confluence was settled. The circuit was complete. The false victory was total.

Now came the autopsy.

# Chapter 19

## **Chapter 19**

The hotel room in George Town smelled of damp plaster and the ghost of a thousand clove cigarettes. It was a cell. A perfect, anonymous cell for the contemplation of impossible things. My grandfather’s journal lay on the cheap laminate desk, its leather cover dark with the oil of his hands and now, the salt of mine. It was not a book. It was a scalpel, left on a sterile tray. I had avoided its sharpest edge for months, skimming the entries about ritual geometry, the properties of specific woods, the migration patterns of crows. I had treated it as a manual. It was a confession.

I sat on the edge of the bed, the springs groaning a familiar complaint. Outside, the afternoon was a thick, yellow syrup, slow and heavy. A motorbike sputtered past, the sound swallowed by the humidity. The silence in the room was different from the temple’s. The temple’s silence was ancient, a held breath. This silence was interim. It was the pause between the diagnosis and the incision.

I opened the journal to the last quarter. The handwriting changed here. It lost its precise, architectural neatness. The lines slanted, crowded together, words bitten off mid-sentence. This was not the writing of a ritualist. This was the writing of a drowning man.

>*March 12th, 1978. The confluence is stable. The anchor points in the temple, the clan house, the old well—they hold. The pressure in the town has eased. The whispers in the market are just whispers again. Not echoes. I should feel relief. I feel nothing. A great hollowing. I have built a dam, but the river I diverted was my own.*

I traced the word *hollowing* with my finger. The ink was dug deep into the paper, a frantic etching. He had succeeded. He had grounded the town’s chaotic, leaking memory into a stable circuit. He had stopped the hauntings, the waking dreams, the children who recited histories they had never learned. He had saved the place. And it had cost him his interior world.

The next pages were diagrams, but not of ritual arrays. They were sketches of a lock mechanism. Intricate, interlocking, beautiful in a cold, mechanical way. In the margins, notes.

>*The vessel must be willing. The lock must be grown, not built. A graft. A psychic graft. The subject’s own memory architecture becomes the housing. The lock is not a thing you have. It is a thing you are. The key, then, is not an object. It is a permission. A surrender of the very self that agreed to be locked.*

My breath hitched. I had built the wall from his instructions, yes. But I had built it from my own material. My grief for my mother, my rootlessness, my obsession with his mystery—these were the mortar. The lock wasn’t in my mind. My mind *was* the lock. The confluence I had just completed wasn’t just grounded through the town; it was grounded through *me*. I was the final anchor point. The living keystone.

The horror of it was quiet. It did not rush in; it seeped, filling the hollows his words had carved. He hadn’t just passed me a curse. He had designed me as its permanent fixture.

I turned the page. A single, stark entry, dated a week later.

>*March 19th. It is done. The procedure is complete. I have taken the core of the disturbance—the unassimilated memory of the ’36 riots, the collective panic that would not settle—and I have sequestered it. I have built the lock within my own recall. I can remember remembering it. I cannot remember the event itself. It is a shape behind frosted glass. A weight with no texture. This is the price. To cure the town, I have given myself a form of psychic aphasia. A selective silence. I am the warden of a ghost I can no longer see.*

>*My wife looks at me. She asks if I want coffee. Her voice is clear. The memory of her face yesterday is clear. But the memory of her face the day we married… there is a fog. It is not gone. It is… managed. Contained within the same architecture. The lock does not discriminate. To hold the violent memory, it must calm all memory. It must dampen the signal. I am a man living in a room where all the lights have been turned very, very low.*

>*This is sustainable. It must be. For her. For my daughter. For the child that is coming.*

The child. My mother.

He had done this not just for the town, but for a daughter who was not yet born. He had entered a half-life to give her a whole one. He had traded the vivid, painful, glorious noise of a complete memory for the safe, quiet hum of a controlled one. He had become a curator of shadows.

And then, the final entry on the page. The handwriting here was so controlled it was brittle.

>*The lock is permanent. The graft is living tissue. To break it is not to pick it. It is to perform a self-lobotomy with a blunt instrument. It would not release the sequestered memory. It would shatter the vessel. The mind would unravel, not into madness, but into a perfect, eternal recall of every single moment, all at once. A terminal confluence. The ultimate, fatal clarity.*

There it was. The surgery manual. The choice.

I could remain the lock. Live in the dim room. A stable, grounded existence. The town would be quiet. I would be… functional. A keeper of quiet histories. My mother’s face would remain clear, but the memory of her voice, the specific timbre of her laugh, would continue to fade into the general idea of her. A slow, gentle erosion of self.

Or I could break the lock. And in doing so, break my own mind. Not into insanity, but into a blinding, catastrophic overload. I would see, know, feel everything—every memory I had ever touched, every stolen ghost, every moment of my own life, my grandfather’s life, the town’s life—in a single, simultaneous explosion of consciousness. It would be the ultimate truth. And it would be fatal.

A third option glimmered, a phantom limb of hope. Could the memory be transferred? Could I, like him, find another vessel, build another lock? But his words were unequivocal. *The vessel must be willing.* Who would be willing? And the graft was specific, grown from my own psychic material. It was not a bullet you could pass to another. It was an organ. My organ.

I closed the journal. The weight of it was absolute. He had not been a coward. He had been a surgeon who knew the operation would leave him crippled, and who had calculated the crippling was worth the life saved. He had looked at the disease of too much knowing and had prescribed a managed amnesia.

And he had left me, his heir, with the same disease, and the same two terrible prescriptions.

The hollow feeling in my chest was not grief. It was comprehension. The false victory of the completed confluence was now complete. I had walked into the trap and heard the door shut behind me. The air was stale. The lights were low.

I stood up, my body moving with the dull precision of an automaton. I walked to the window, pushed the slatted blinds apart. The lane below was a tableau of ordinary life. A woman hung washing on a bamboo pole. A cat slept in a patch of sun. An old man read a newspaper on a stool. Their memories were their own. Simple, linear, private. I envied them with a violence that shocked me.

My grandfather’s moment of decision was not a dramatic one. It was this. This quiet, terrible clarity in a cheap room. The understanding that every path forward is a form of loss. He chose to lose the vividness of his own life. To save others from the haunting.

What was I saving?

Not the town. It was already saved. He had done that.

My mother was ashes in a celadon pot.

There was no child to protect.

There was only the truth. And the self.

The hook for the next chapter was no longer about understanding the choice. It was about inventory. If I was to be a lock, I needed to know what I was containing. If I was to break, I needed to know what would be lost. I needed to see the shape behind the frosted glass. I needed to remember the thing my grandfather had chosen to forget.

The 1936 riots. The collective panic. The unassimilated memory.

I had touched its edges in the temple, in the clan house. A fever-dream of running, of smoke, of a terrible sound that was both a shout and a sob. But I had never let it in. I had been a scholar, an investigator. I had treated it as data.

Now, I had to become its patient.

I left the journal on the desk. I walked out of the hotel room, down the stairs that smelled of mildew and frying garlic. The woman at the desk nodded, her eyes on a small television. I was a ghost to her. A temporary fixture.

I walked without direction, my feet on the hot pavement. The town’s memory was calm now, a deep, still lake beneath my feet. The confluence held. I was the anchor. I could feel the steady, low thrum of it in my teeth, in the marrow of my bones. It was not unpleasant. It was a sedation.

I found myself at the edge of the old Chinese cemetery, where the granite stones leaned like tired teeth. This was one of his anchor points. The memory here was old, slow, mineral. The deep time of roots and stone. I sat on a low wall, the sun warming my back.

To perform the autopsy, I had to open the body. My body.

I closed my eyes. I did not reach for a memory. I lowered the walls I had spent months building. Not to break them, but to open a viewing port. A surgical window.

I focused on the fuzzy, dark shape my grandfather had described. The memory behind the glass. The 1936 riots. I stopped pushing it away. I invited it in.

It came not as a vision, but as a sensory flood.

The smell hit first: not just smoke, but the specific, acrid scent of burning rubber from the nearby godowns. Then the taste of panic, metallic and sour, at the back of my throat. Sounds—not the clear report of history, but a cacophony: a woman’s scream spliced with the shatter of glass, the thud of running boots on different streets, all at once, a stereo effect of terror. A jumble of tactile memories that were not mine: the rough weave of a sack pulled over a head, the slick warmth of blood on cobblestones, the desperate grip of a child’s hand.

And beneath it all, the core. Not the violence itself, but the moment the town’s mind broke. The moment a community’s private fears and rumours and ancient grudges, fueled by colonial manipulation and economic desperation, coalesced into a single, shared psychic explosion. It was not a memory of an event. It was the memory of a fracture. A psychic shockwave that had ripped through the collective unconscious, leaving a wound that would not heal. A memory so traumatic, so inherently *communal*, that it could not be processed by individual minds. It had become a ghost in the system, replaying, seeking resolution.

My grandfather had not locked away a historical record. He had locked away a psychic infection. A self-replicating loop of fear.

And I had just plugged myself directly into it.

My eyes flew open. I was on my hands and knees on the gravel path, vomiting nothing but bile. The world swam. The calm, grounded hum of the confluence was now a distorted scream, filtered through the old terror. The trees in the cemetery seemed to lean in, whispering not with leaf-rustle, but with the echoes of old curses.

I had my diagnosis. The disease was not just knowing. It was *feeling* collectively. It was the obliteration of the boundary between self and other, between past and present. My grandfather’s lock didn’t just dampen memory; it enforced the boundary. It rebuilt the psychic immune system the town had lost.

To break the lock was to dissolve that boundary entirely. To become the town, the past, the fear, the joy, the birth, the death—all of it, forever. A perfect, endless empathy. A death by communion.

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand. The taste of metal remained. The choice was now visceral. It was in my gut, in my trembling hands.

I could live as a boundary. A living wall. A quiet, fading curator.

Or I could become an ocean. And drown in everything.

I pushed myself up. The sun had moved. The patch of light was gone. The cat had left. The ordinary world had continued its turn, oblivious to the abyss that had just opened within one of its temporary fixtures.

I began the long walk back to the hotel. The collective memory of the town flowed around me, a river I had now dammed. I felt its pressure against the lock in my mind. A steady, insistent push.

My grandfather’s journal had given me the autopsy report. It had shown me the nature of the cancer. Now I had felt its metastasis.

The hook for the next chapter was no longer about choice, or diagnosis. It was about execution. How does one live as a wall? How does one perform the daily, minute rituals of self-erosion? Or, if one chooses the ocean, how does one take the final, deliberate step off the cliff?

I needed to see how he did it. Not the moment of decision, but the living with it. The decades of dim light. I needed to find the traces of the man he became after the lock was sealed. The ghost of my grandfather that lived *after* the journal ended.

The answer would not be in a book. It would be in the spaces he inhabited. The house he lived in. The routines he kept. The silence he cultivated.

I needed to go home. Not to the hotel. To his house. The one my mother left, the one I had never seen. The place where the lock had been a living thing, a third presence at the dinner table, in the marital bed, in the nursery.

The confluence was stable. The patient was prepped.

Now came the practice of living with the knife still inside.

# Chapter 20

## **Chapter 20**

The house was not a house. It was a held breath.

It sat at the end of Jalan Bintang, a narrow lane where the asphalt surrendered to packed earth and the streetlights gave up their vigil. A single-storey bungalow, its whitewash the colour of old bone under the bruise-purple sky of late afternoon. The roof was terracotta tile, moss furring the edges. A wrought-iron gate, scabbed with rust, stood slightly ajar, as if someone had left in a hurry and forgotten to pull it shut. Fifty years ago.

I stopped at the threshold. The physical boundary was a formality. The real boundary was the one I carried inside my skull, the lock I had tested against the town’s memory-stream. That pressure was a constant now, a low-grade hum at the base of my spine, the psychic equivalent of a decaying tooth. I had spent the walk from the hotel practicing the first ritual of self-erosion: the deliberate narrowing of perception. I focused on the grit under my shoe, the specific ache in my left calf, the dry catch in my throat. Not the memories that lapped at the edges, not the ghost-impressions of a hundred passersby left in the air like scent. Just the body. A temporary fixture.

Pushing the gate, its whine was a long, arthritic syllable. The front garden was a testament to strategic neglect. Not wild, but curated into a state of non-being. A square of bald, hard-packed earth. A single frangipani tree, its limbs knotted and wise, shedding waxy, yellow-white flowers onto the ground where they lay like discarded flesh. No hedge, no potted plants, no bench. Nothing to invite lingering. The path to the door was made of concrete slabs, each one set just a fraction too far apart for a comfortable stride. A forced mindfulness.

This was the architecture of a living wall.

The front door was heavy teak, darkened by decades of sun and monsoon. The brass knocker was a simple loop, green with verdegris. I did not use it. My mother’s key was in my palm, a cold, simple tooth of metal. It felt absurdly small against the weight of the door. The lock turned with a sound like a bone cracking, deep within the house’s throat.

The smell hit me first. Not decay, not mildew. It was the smell of air that had been still for a very long time. Dried wood, the ghost of old polish, dust, and beneath it all, a faint, clean astringency—like camphor, or the memory of rain. I stepped inside and closed the door behind me. The outside world, the sounds of distant motorbikes and birdsong, vanished. The silence here was a substance. It had density. It pressed against my eardrums.

I stood in a short, dark hallway. The floor was terrazzo, cool and speckled. A single, narrow window of frosted glass at the far end allowed a diluted grey light to seep in, illuminating motes of dust that hung, suspended, in no particular hurry. To my left, an open doorway led to a sitting room. To my right, a closed door. Straight ahead, the hallway ended at what looked like a kitchen.

I went left.

The sitting room was a lesson in absence. Two plain wooden armchairs, upholstered in a faded, dun-coloured fabric, faced each other across a low, unvarnished table. No sofa. No bookshelves. No photographs on the walls, which were painted a flat, light-absorbing cream. In one corner, a wooden cabinet held a simple turntable and a stack of records, their spines uniform and blank. A single, framed piece of embroidery hung on the far wall. I moved closer. It was a Chinese character, 靜, *jing*. Stillness. Tranquillity. It was stitched in black thread on white silk, the edges of the frame without dust. A focal point. An instruction.

This was not a room for living. It was a room for waiting. The chairs were placed not for conversation with another, but for confrontation with the self. The space between them was a carefully measured gulf. I tried to imagine my grandfather here, after my grandmother’s death, after my mother’s flight. Sitting in one chair, the empty one opposite him holding all the ghosts. Maintaining the lock. Performing the daily ritual of not-listening, not-feeling, not-remembering. The practice of living with the knife still inside.

I backed out, my own breathing too loud.

The closed door to my right was his bedroom. The knob turned smoothly. The room was monastic. A single bed, narrow and firm-looking, made with military precision. A plain wooden wardrobe. A small writing desk under a window that looked out onto the blank side wall of the neighbouring house. On the desk: a blotter, an inkwell dried solid, a fountain pen laid parallel to the desk’s edge. No personal effects. No books. The only deviation was on the wall above the bed. Not a crucifix, but a detailed, anatomical diagram of the human ear, labelled in precise, Chinese characters. The tympanic membrane, the ossicles, the cochlea. The machinery of listening. Here, where he slept, was a map of the very organ he had spent a lifetime teaching to be deaf.

It was in the kitchen that I found the first trace of the ghost that lived after the journal ended.

The kitchen was clean, spare, functional. But on the small Formica table, pushed against the wall, was a single object that did not belong to utility. A mortar and pestle. The mortar was a deep, heavy granite bowl. The pestle, lying across its top, was dark, smooth wood, worn from use. Around it, on the pale green tabletop, was a faint, permanent stain—a constellation of dark spots and smears. Herbs, roots, pigments ground to powder over decades.

This was not for cooking. This was his practice.

I picked up the pestle. The wood was warm, as if recently held. The weight of it was familiar, comforting. I placed it back with a quiet *click*. This was where he came, after sitting in the silent room, after sleeping under the diagram of the ear. To grind. To reduce something whole into something fine, controllable, inert. A daily, physical metaphor for the psychic lock. The transmutation of experience into dust.

But a metaphor was not enough. The lock was a specific, trained discipline. It had a mechanism. The journal described the theory, the crisis. It did not describe the drills.

I returned to the hallway. There was one more door, beside the kitchen. A storage room, or perhaps a second bedroom. It was locked. Not with a key, but with a small, sturdy padlock, new against the old wood. My mother’s key did not fit.

I went back to the sitting room, to the cabinet with the records. I knelt, my knees popping in the silence. The records were all of a type. Not music. Field recordings. The labels were typed, clinical. *Ambient Rainfall, Highland Region. Dawn Chorus, East Coast Mangrove. Urban Traffic Intersection, 1978.* I slid one out. The vinyl was pristine, untouched by dust. I placed it on the turntable, lifted the arm, and set the needle down.

A hiss, then a low, pervasive roar filled the room. It was rain, but not the gentle patter of a shower. This was a torrential, monsoon downpour, a wall of white noise. It had no beginning, no end, no narrative. It was pure, undifferentiated sound. I sat in one of the armchairs. The sound enveloped me, a sonic blanket. It was not meant to be listened *to*. It was meant to be listened *against*. A screen. A buffer between the mind and the world’s psychic murmur. This was one drill. Drown the memory-stream in a louder, simpler stream of noise.

I lifted the needle. The silence rushed back, thicker than before.

The padlocked door called to me. It was the only thing in the house that spoke of secrecy, not just absence. The lock was a modern intrusion. My grandfather would not have put it there. My mother must have, on her one return after his death. A final act of curation. *Do not look here.*

The tools were in the kitchen. A small, sharp cleaver and a heavy iron wok. I took them to the hallway. I did not hesitate. Hesitation was a form of listening to the self. I wedged the cleaver’s tip between the hasp and the doorframe, placed the wok against the back of the blade for leverage, and pushed. Wood splintered with a shriek that tore through the house’s held breath. The hasp twisted, held for a second, then tore free from the rotting timber. The padlock clattered to the terrazzo floor.

The door swung inward.

This was not a storage room. It had been a nursery.

The walls were a soft, faded yellow. A mobile of carved wooden birds, grey with dust, hung motionless over a simple crib. A small chest of drawers stood against one wall. The room was empty of life, yet it vibrated with a terrible, poignant potential. This was the space prepared for a child who never arrived. For my mother, before she was my mother. Before she was anything but a hope that curdled into a silence.

But that was not what my mother had locked away.

In the centre of the room, arranged with a chilling neatness, was my grandfather’s true workshop. This was not the place of metaphor. This was the laboratory.

A low, wide table held an array of objects. A metronome, its pendulum still. A set of tuning forks of different sizes on a felt pad. A small, intricate loom, with a half-finished weaving of black and white threads. A kaleidoscope. A stack of cards with intricate, hypnotic patterns—Mandalas, spirals, labyrinths. A bottle of clear liquid with a dropper, labelled in his precise hand: *Camphor / Menthol Solution*. Next to it, a notebook, smaller and thicker than the journal.

This was the regimen. The daily calisthenics for the mind’s gate.

I picked up the notebook. It was a log. Dates, times, exercises. Not descriptions of content, but measurements of effect.

*April 12, 1968. Tuning fork C-256, 20 minutes. Peripheral murmur reduced by estimated 40%. Resonance in left mastoid. Followed with Pattern 7 (concentric circles) for 15 mins. Achieved surface blankness. Depth pressure remains.*

*November 3, 1972. Loom work, black/white contrast. Tactile focus successful. Auditory incursion from neighbour’s memory (quarrel) breached at minute 18. Required camphor inhalation to re-establish barrier.*

*August 19, 1981. Monsoon recording at 85 decibels. Effective white wall. No discernible leakage. However, noted emotional flattening persists for 4 hours post-session. Empathy index near zero. Acceptable trade-off.*

The entries were a cold, clinical chronicle of a war of attrition. He wasn’t just building a wall. He was performing a precise, daily neurosurgery on his own soul, cauterising the connections that led to empathy, to connection. The loom, the patterns, the tuning forks—they were tools for hyper-focus, for forcing the mind into a narrow, sterile channel until the wider river of other people’s memories could not flow in. The camphor was a chemical reset. The metronome was for rhythm, a beat to replace the heartbeat of the town.

This was how one lived as a wall. Not through grand, stoic resolve. Through a brutal, meticulous routine of sensory manipulation and cognitive narrowing. A lifetime of drills.

The last entry was dated just a week before the date on his death certificate.

*February 2, 1999. Full regimen. Barrier integrity stable at 94%. Flattening profound. Saw a kingfisher at the well. Felt nothing. Not even the memory of feeling. The lock is complete. It is also a tomb. I have preserved the house. I have extinguished the occupant.*

I closed the notebook. My hands were steady. The pressure in my own skull seemed to pulse in sympathy with his recorded numbers. He had given me the autopsy report. Now he had given me the surgeon’s manual.

But there was one more thing on the table. A flat, rectangular box of polished rosewood. I opened it.

Inside, nestled on a bed of faded velvet, was a set of long, silver needles. Acupuncture needles, but finer, longer. Beside them, a small, hand-drawn diagram was tucked into the lid. It showed a profile of a human head, with points marked along the skull, behind the ear, at the base of the neck. Not traditional acupuncture points. These were new. Invented. The labels were in his hand: *Gate 1 (Tympanic Dampener). Gate 2 (Cochlear Diverter). Gate 3 (Empathic Nerve Block).*

Beneath the diagram, a note.

*For the final seal. When the drills are insufficient. Physical intervention at the neural crossroads. Theory is sound. Practice is irreversible. The ultimate erosion. To be used only when the ocean’s pull threatens to dissolve the final grain of self. I have never had the courage. Or the despair.*

I stared at the needles. They glinted in the weak light from the nursery window. This was the final, deliberate step off the cliff. Not a metaphorical drowning, but a precise, medical silencing of the very faculty that made the ocean possible. A severing. He had crafted the tool, mapped the procedure, but had chosen, in the end, to live with the knife inside rather than to perform the final, self-inflicted excision.

I understood his hesitation now. The drills were a discipline. The needles were an amputation.

The weight of his decades settled upon me, not as a memory, but as a future. This room, this box, this log—they were a prophecy. This was the path of the wall. A life of metronomes and camphor, of daily audits of one’s own humanity, measuring the percentage of feeling successfully erased. A slow, meticulous becoming of nothing.

The hook for the next chapter was no longer about his practice. It was about the failure of mine. I had dammed the river. I felt its pressure. I had the surgeon’s manual. But sitting in this nursery of un-lived futures, with the silver needles gleaming like promises of peace, I knew with a cold, clear certainty that I lacked the surgeon’s nerve. Or his cowardice. I could not do this for decades. I would break. The ocean would win.

But the ocean was death. A beautiful, total death by communion.

There had to be a third way. Not wall, not ocean. Something that was not in my grandfather’s journal, nor in his grim logbook. A path he never saw because he was looking only at the lock, and at the abyss.

I needed to find what he had missed. What the confluence, in its perfect, endless empathy, might have overlooked. A flaw in the system. A back door.

It would not be in this house of held breaths. It would be in the one place where the confluence’s memory was weakest. Where its empathy failed. The one story the town did not tell, because it did not understand it. The story of the one who got away.

My mother.

She had left. She had broken the chain. She had lived a life of sharp, defined boundaries in a foreign city, loved a man, raised a child, died of ordinary cancer. She had been, in her own way, free of this. She had not been a wall. She had not drowned. She had simply left.

How?
The answer was not in her ashes. It was in her life before she left. In the space between the nursery that never was and the train she eventually boarded. In the moments my grandfather, in his focused, desperate drilling, had failed to see. The moments the confluence, for all its reach, had failed to properly record.

I took the box of needles. I took the logbook. I left the nursery, the shattered lock, the house of practiced silence. I closed the front door on the smell of camphor and dust. The evening air outside was a shock, thick with the scent of night-blooming jasmine and distant cooking fires. It felt like a riot.

The pressure in my skull surged, a wave of other people’s evenings, their worries, their small joys, rushing into the space vacated by the house’s nullity. I let it come. I did not raise the metronome, or seek a pattern. I stood on the broken path, holding the tools of my own potential erasure, and I listened.

Somewhere in the cacophony of the town’s living memory was a silence. A shaped, deliberate silence. The silence my mother had made when she chose a different kind of life. I needed to find its edges. To trace the outline of her escape.

The confluence was stable. The patient was prepped. The surgeon’s tools were in my hand.

Now came the search for the cure he never sought.

# Chapter 21

## **Chapter 21**

The jasmine was a lie. It was a sweet, cloying veil over the deeper stench of the town—wet earth, stagnant *kalis*, the faint, metallic tang of rust from the old tin dredge pond on the western edge. I walked, the needles a cold weight in my pocket, the logbook a brick against my ribs. The pressure in my skull was not a wave now, but a settled fog, dense with particulate detail. A child’s stubbed toe throbbed two streets over. An old man’s regret over a poorly sold bicycle was a sour pebble lodged behind my eyes. A woman’s quiet satisfaction at the perfect doneness of her *ikan bakar* was a warm, fleeting oil-slick on the surface of my mind.

I did not sort it. I let it be. The metronome was still. This was not a search for pattern, but for its antithesis.

My mother’s silence.

Not the nullity of the house, that practiced, vacuum-sealed absence. This was different. An active silence. A silence that had *done* something. She had carved a shape out of the noise and stepped through it. To find the outline, I had to feel the noise itself, in all its directionless, democratic anguish.

I walked toward the river. The town’s memory was strongest there, in the place of its making and unmaking. The *kali* was the original conduit, the first vein. Its banks were soft with other people’s pasts.

The footpath was cracked concrete, sprouting weeds like coarse hair. The shophouses gave way to wooden stilt-houses, their underbellies cluttered with broken rattan furniture and chicken coops. The river smell rose—not clean, but organic, a breath of decomposition and relentless growth. I found a low, moss-slicked retaining wall and sat. The water was the colour of weak tea, carrying a plastic bag like a languid jellyfish.

I closed my eyes. I let the confluence breathe.

It was not a single story. It was a sediment. Layer upon layer of feeling settling into the mud. The sharp panic of a boy falling in, 1978. The weary ache of a woman washing clothes, year after year, her knuckles bleaching to the colour of bone. The furtive, thrilling guilt of a stolen kiss behind the rambutan tree, 1992. The towns were gone, the faces blurred, but the emotions remained, pristine and specific. They had seeped into the water, the soil, the very air. This was the town’s true self. Not the buildings, but this accumulated, psychic silt.

And somewhere in this strata was the layer that was my mother. Lin Mei. Before she was my mother. Before she was ash in a celadon pot.

I reached for her. Not with a name, but with the quality of her absence from here. The shape of the hole she left.

The fog in my mind shifted. The mundane sensations of the present evening receded, like a tide pulling back. What rose in its place was older, grainier. The emotional weather of thirty-five years ago. A tautness. A held breath that was not the house’s nullity, but something more anxious, more watchful.

I saw—no, I *felt*—the riverbank not as it was, but as it had been. The stilt-houses newer, the paint less peeled. The same plastic bag probably floated by, in a previous incarnation. And there, a presence.

Not her. The space around her.

A particular stretch of wall, three houses down from where I sat, hummed with a strange, resonant emptiness. It was not empty of memory. It was dense with the memory of being watched. Of being a focal point.

I opened my eyes. The present snapped back. The wall was just a wall, stained with watermarks and political graffiti from an election nobody remembered. I walked to it. The concrete was rough under my palm. The confluence here was a prickling static, a nervous system on edge.

This was where she came. Not to be with the river, but to be away from the house. To be unseen, but also, paradoxically, to see. This was her lookout. Her blind.

I pressed my forehead to the cool concrete. I asked the question, not with words, but with the intent of my search. *What did you see here?*

The confluence answered not with an image, but with an imprint. A habit of attention.

It showed me the view. Not as a picture, but as a series of focal points, like a security camera panning on a fixed track. From this spot, the sightlines were clear. Downriver, to where the Chinese jetty once was, now collapsed. Upriver, to the bend where the Indian fishermen used to mend their nets. Directly across, to the dense thicket of bamboo and wild banana that had since been cleared for a welding shop.

And the path from the town market, leading to the bridge.

She had stood here and watched the comings and goings. Not with a child’s curiosity, but with a strategist’s cold assessment. She was mapping the rhythms of escape. The ferry schedule to the mainland. The mail truck’s arrival. The times when the bridge was empty, when a person could cross without becoming a subject of gossip.

This was her planning silence. A silence of calculation.

But it was not the escape itself. This was the theory. I needed the practice. The moment of fracture.

I followed the imprint of her attention back from the wall, tracing the path she would have taken home. Not the main road, but a warren of back alleys, a servant’s route. The confluence was thinner here, less nourished by grand emotions. These were spaces of utility, of chores, of things not worth remembering vividly. The memories were faint, like pencil sketches nearly erased.

Halfway, behind the shuttered shell of the old Hainanese coffee shop, the alley narrowed. A high brick wall on one side, choked with trumpet vine. A drain on the other. The air was cooler, the light dim.

Here, the silence changed.

It was not the planning silence. It was a spike of pure, voidal negation. A memory so violently suppressed it had left a scar in the confluence itself. A black spot.

I stopped. The pressure in my head didn’t surge. It *dropped*. A sudden, dizzying plunge, like stepping off a cliff in the dark. My ears popped. The ambient murmur of the town’s past vanished. In this three-meter stretch of alley, there was nothing. No stored joy, no fear, no boredom. It was a perfect auditory blind spot.

This was it. Not where she planned. Where she *acted*.

I stood in the center of the null zone. The ordinary sounds of the present—a distant motorbike, a television laugh track—seemed fake, tinny, layered over a profound and absolute quiet. This was a silence that had been *made*. Not by the confluence’s empathy, but by a human will so fierce it had burned the memory out of the very air.

My grandfather’s drilling had missed this. His focus was on the house, on the nursery, on the direct line of inheritance. He had looked for a confrontation, a transaction. He had not thought to look for a secret forged in a forgotten alley.

What happened here?

I had the tools. The needles, the logbook. The protocols for finding and reinforcing memory. But this was the opposite. This was archaeology of an anti-memory. To find it, I would have to stimulate the surrounding tissue, the memories that bordered this void. To trace the contours of the hole by illuminating its edges.

I sat on the damp ground, my back against the cool brick. I opened the logbook. The evening light was failing, but I knew the pages by feel now. The diagrams, the frequencies, the cautionary notes in my grandfather’s tight script: *Overstimulation of border zones may cause bleed-through, identity contamination.*

I was beyond caution.

I selected a needle. Not the longest, but the one with the finest gauge, designed for precise, shallow work. I rolled up my left sleeve. I did not sterilize the site. The act was not medical. It was ritual.

The first insertion was at the temple, just anterior to the ear. A shallow penetration, following the path of the superficial temporal artery. The metal was a cold kiss, then a bright, specific pain. I did not connect it to the machine. This was manual. I would be the probe.

I focused on the border of the null zone. The memory just before the alley. I pulled it from the confluence—the feeling of the coffee shop owner, Uncle Tan, sweeping his front step in the morning, a low-grade worry about his son’s gambling debts a constant hum in his chest. A mundane, durable memory.

I held it in my mind, then I took a step forward, into the void.

The memory shattered. Not faded. *Shattered*. Like glass hitting a tile floor. The shock was physical. A jolt up my arm, into my jaw. The null zone wasn’t passive. It was defensive. It repelled.

I breathed through the numbness in my teeth. I tried another border memory, from the other side. A young woman hurrying down the alley late for work, her irritation a sharp, citrus sting.

Step forward.

*Snap*. Another fracture. A flash of white behind my eyes.

This wasn’t working. I was throwing pebbles at a black hole. The edges were too clean, too violently maintained.

I needed a different approach. Not to probe the edges, but to ask the void a direct question. To use the confluence’s own empathy against the scar. To offer it a feeling so potent it might force a reflection, however distorted.

I thought of my mother in her final weeks. Not the sickroom smell, not the morphine haze. I thought of her hands. How they had restlessly plucked at the hospital sheet, not in weakness, but in a familiar, impatient gesture. The same gesture she used when waiting for a slow clerk, or for me to finish a tedious childhood story. A gesture of profound, contained intolerance for the pace of the world. A gesture that said, *I have places to be*.

I distilled that feeling. The essential, irreducible *her*-ness of that impatience. I formed it in my mind, a hard, brilliant gem of recognition.

I did not step forward. I sat, in the heart of the void, and I *pushed* that feeling into the silence.

For a long moment, nothing. The void absorbed it, a stone dropped into a well with no bottom.

Then, a tremor.

A sound, or the memory of a sound, cracked the silence like thin ice. A voice. Not my mother’s. A man’s voice. Low, urgent, frayed at the edges with a fear so deep it had ceased to be panic and become something colder.

*“You cannot. It is not a door. It is a mouth. It will take everything.”*

The voice was familiar. The cadence, the slight anglicised accent over the Hokkien. Dr. Rao.

My grandfather’s collaborator. The architect of the confluence.

This was not a memory he had given to the town. This was a private memory, his own. And somehow, it had been caught, trapped in the scar my mother had left.

My mother’s voice, when it came, was young. Younger than I had ever heard it. Not the firm, clipped tone of my childhood, but lighter, sharper, edged with a defiance that had not yet been tempered by motherhood and mortgage payments.

*“It already has taken everything. I am just crumbs on the table. I would rather be eaten than be part of the feast.”*

A pause. The void swirled, resisting, but the gem of my recognition held, a lodestone.

Dr. Rao’s voice, softer now, defeated. *“There is a… a seam. In the empathy. A place it cannot look, because to look would be to judge. It has no moral shape. It only accepts. If you can find a feeling it cannot accept… a feeling so pure in its selfishness, so singular in its desire, that it has no echo in anyone else… you can slip through. But to find it, you must be that feeling. You must be utterly, terrifyingly alone.”*

*“How?”*

*“I do not know. I built the cage. I did not study the keys. But she… your friend. The one who dances. She is not a wall. She is a weathervane. She feels the emotional pressure of the town, but she does not *join* it. She is a separate instrument. Find her. Watch her. When the pressure is wrong—when the town feels a grief or a joy that is not its own—that is the seam. That is the draft under the door.”*

The friend who danced.

Aunty Mala.

The memory fractured then, the void reasserting itself with a final, crushing weight. The voices were gone. But the words hung in the air, in me.

I pulled the needle from my temple. A bead of blood welled, warm and immediate. I wiped it away with my thumb.

The surgery had its landmark. Not a back door in the code. A flaw in the premise. The confluence was built on empathy, on shared feeling. Its blind spot was the truly, irreducibly singular. The selfish. The alone.

My mother had found that in herself. A desire for a life so particular, so *hers*, that it resonated with no one else in this town of woven sorrows. She had become a note so pure it was silence to their ears. And she had walked through.

But she had help. Rao knew. And Aunty Mala, the weathervane, the town’s sensitive, had been the indicator.

I stood up. My legs were weak. The fog of the town’s present memory rushed back in, a cacophonous relief after the absolute quiet. A child was crying for a lost ball. Someone was frying garlic. It was all so loud, so desperately shared.

I knew what I had to do. The cure my grandfather never sought wasn’t a refinement of the confluence. It was its antithesis. I had to find, within myself, a feeling that belonged to no one but me. A desire with no echo. And I had to use Aunty Mala to find the seam.

But first, I had to ask her what she remembered of the girl who became a silence, and the doctor who knew too much.

I left the alley, the scar of my mother’s defiance already healing over in the confluence behind me, a secret kept once more. The night was full now, the sky a bruised purple. The lights from the stilt-houses reflected in the black river, broken into a thousand shimmering pieces. I walked back toward the heart of the town, toward the coffee shop where Aunty Mala held her evening court.

The tools in my pocket felt different. Not instruments of erasure, but of definition. To save this town, I would not become a better wall. I would have to learn to become a knife. To cut myself out.

And to do that, I needed to find the one person who had seen the knife before.

# Chapter 22

## **Chapter 22**

Aunty Mala’s coffee shop was a cave of yellow light in the purple dusk. The air, thick with the sweet burn of *kopi* and the greasy perfume of frying *kaya* toast, felt like a physical barrier after the sterile silence of the alley. Sound returned in a wave—the clatter of ceramic, the wet slap of a rag on formica, the low, conspiratorial rumble of old men dissecting the weather. It was the town’s living memory, warm and uncurated. I stood on the threshold, letting the noise wash over me, feeling the confluence’s gentle, insistent pull trying to knit me back into its fabric. *You are here. You are one of us. Your solitude is a misunderstanding.*

I saw her at the back, holding court at her usual table. Aunty Mala was a small woman, her frame swallowed by a faded floral *baju kurung*, but she occupied space like a general. Her hands, never still, moved in a continuous ballet—pouring tea, adjusting a saucer, punctuating a story. Her eyes, dark and quick as a sparrow’s, missed nothing. They landed on me now, and the story she was telling—something about a misdelivered chicken—did not falter, but her gaze held mine for a beat too long. A recognition, not of my face, but of my state. I was a discordant note, and her sensitivity, that weathervane attunement to the town’s emotional climate, had already registered the shift in pressure.

I wove through the crowded tables. Conversations dipped as I passed, then rose again, a little too brightly. My mother’s absence was a ghost limb in this room; they felt its ache in me, and it made them polite, distant. I reached her table.

“Aunty.”

“*Ah.* The doctor’s granddaughter.” She did not smile. She gestured to the empty chair opposite her with a tilt of her chin. “Sit. You look like you have been talking to ghosts. It is bad for the digestion.”

I sat. The vinyl seat was warm. She pushed a small, handleless cup of untouched tea toward me. It was milky and orange, oversweet. A peace offering, or a test.

“Thank you.”

“You have his hands,” she said, her eyes on my fingers as they curled around the hot cup. “Precise. But your eyes are your mother’s. Always looking at the door.”

The directness was a slap. I took a sip of the tea. It was cloying, a childhood taste. “I need to ask you about her. And about Dr. Rao.”

Aunty Mala’s hands stilled for the first time. She placed her own cup down with a soft *click*. The old men at the neighboring table found a sudden, deep interest in the ceiling fan.

“Some stories,” she said, her voice dropping into a register meant only for me, “are not for this shop. Some memories have sharp edges. They cut the tongue that holds them.”

“I know she left. I know Rao helped her. I was just… in the place where it happened.”

Her eyes widened, just a fraction. A crack in her composure. She leaned forward, and the scent of jasmine soap and ground coffee enveloped me. “You went to the blind spot? The alley by the old generator?”

I nodded.

“And you are still here. Still… coherent.” She said the word like it was a medical diagnosis. She studied my face, looking for cracks, for the glazed look of someone half-assimilated. “Most who stumble in there come out babbling, or silent for weeks. The town has to… recalibrate around them. It is a tear. A little nothingness. We are taught to walk around it.”

“What do you remember of that day? The day she walked into it?”

Aunty Mala sat back, her gaze turning inward. The coffee shop’s noise seemed to recede, as if she had drawn a curtain around us. “It was not a day. It was a season. Your mother… she was a still pool in a river. We all flow, here. We feel the rains upstream, the thirst downstream. Our joys are communal, our sorrows a shared weight. But her? She was a vessel that would not tip. She took in the light, the sound, the feeling, and it… stayed there. It did not pour out into the confluence. It was beautiful, at first. A quiet place to rest. Then it became… unsettling.”

She took a slow breath, her fingers tracing a water stain on the table. “We thought it was grief. For your father, for the life before. We poured our comfort into her. I myself, I sat with her for hours, letting my own calm seep toward her. It was like pouring water into a sealed jar. It just washed over the outside. She was polite. She was grateful. And she was utterly, completely alone inside. The confluence could not touch her core. It registered her as a… a pleasant shape. A silhouette. The substance was hidden.”

“And Rao?”

Aunty Mala’s lips thinned. “He watched. Not like the rest of us. Not with worry, or confusion. With… interest. Clinical interest. He was the town’s keeper, the one who smoothed the edges when the shared feeling grew too jagged. He was the best of us at feeling the weave. And he felt the hole she was becoming. One evening, he came to me. He asked me not what I felt *for* her, but what I felt *from* her. A subtle difference.”

“What did you tell him?”

“I told him it was like a note from a song none of us knew. It was in tune, but it belonged to another scale. It was perfect, and it was alien.” She looked at me, her expression grim. “He thanked me. He said that was the confirmation. He said, ‘Mala, what if the cure for our occasional sickness is not a stronger bond, but a permitted solitude? A controlled release valve?’ I did not understand. I thought he meant a holiday. A trip to Penang.”

She fell silent for a long moment, the memory playing out behind her eyes. “The day it happened, the town was heavy. A fishing boat had been lost in a squall. Two brothers. The grief was a thick fog, sweet and suffocating. It was in the *teh tarik*, in the mud by the river. We were all drowning in it together. It was the kind of day the confluence was *for*—to bear the unbearable, by sharing its weight.”

“And my mother?”

“She came to me here. At this table. She was… clear. Like glass. The shared grief did not cling to her. She said, ‘Mala, I cannot breathe this air anymore. It is not mine to breathe.’ I thought she was speaking of sadness. I took her hand, and I pushed my own calm at her, hard. I pushed the image of a quiet sunrise, of still water. She squeezed my hand, and she smiled. It was the most heartbreaking smile I have ever seen. Full of love, and full of goodbye. She said, ‘That is beautiful. But it is yours. I have to go find mine.’ Then she let go and walked out.”

Aunty Mala’s voice grew hushed. “I felt it happen. Not through the confluence. Through the… rip. One moment she was a silhouette in the doorway. The next, she was a silhouette in nothing. A hole punched in the world. The town’s grief for the brothers stuttered. For a full minute, we all forgot they were dead. We felt only this… new, clean absence. Then the memory of the brothers rushed back in, confused, tangled with this other loss we could not name. It was Rao who stabilized it. He was there, in the street, directing the… the emotional traffic. He soothed the panic, gently steered the collective memory away from the alley, layered over the rip with a stronger memory of the brothers’ laughter. He mended the weave. And he made sure the tear your mother left behind was remembered only as a vague, unpleasant place to avoid. A draft. A nothing.”

I felt cold. The tea in my cup had formed a skin. “He didn’t try to stop her.”

“No,” Aunty Mala whispered. “I believe he held the door.”

We sat in the echo of that truth. The tools in my pocket—the needle, the vial—felt like artifacts from a forgotten war. My grandfather’s cure was a fantasy of a better lock. My mother’s escape was a key made of pure self. And Rao? Rao was the locksmith who understood the mechanism needed both.

“He knew the system’s flaw,” I said, more to myself than to her. “The confluence requires empathy. Shared resonance. A truly singular, selfish desire is invisible to it. It’s a silence in the chorus. He used my mother to prove it.”

Aunty Mala nodded slowly. “And now you are here. With your grandfather’s tools and your mother’s eyes. What is your singular desire, girl? To save us? That is a shared wish. It will not work.”

I looked at my hands—my grandfather’s precise, surgical hands. I thought of the needle, not as an eraser, but as a scalpel. I thought of the flaw in the premise.

“No,” I said, my voice quiet but firm in the hum of the shop. “Not to save the town. To save myself *from* it. To cut myself out. Not to disappear into a silence, like my mother. But to define my own edges, while still being here. To be a knife, not a wall.”

Aunty Mala’s sharp eyes softened, just for a moment, with something that looked like pity. “That is a harder thing. A wall just is. A knife must be wielded. It must cut something. What will you cut?”

“The threads that bind me to the collective memory. Not all of them. Just the… the parasitic ones. The ones that are not mine.”
“And for that, you need a seam. A place to start the cut.”
“Yes. I need you to find it for me. You felt her singularity. You feel the town’s weave. I need you to feel *me*. To find the feeling in me that is mine alone, the one that does not echo here. That is my blade. And I need you to guide it to the seam.”
She paled. “You are asking me to betray the confluence. To use my gift against its purpose.”
“I’m asking you to help me perfect it. A system that cannot tolerate a single independent thought is a doomed system. It’s a brain with no immune system, attacking the one cell that is different. Rao knew that. He just didn’t know how to fix it. He only knew how to… excise the anomaly. I want to build a tolerance.”
The word hung in the air between us. *Tolerance*. It was a colder, more clinical word than *community*, than *shared sorrow*. It spoke of friction, of managed difference.
Aunty Mala closed her eyes. Her weathervane sensitivity was turned inward now, toward me. I could feel it, a delicate probing at the edges of my self, like fingertips brushing over a closed lid. I did not open up. I did not push. I simply sat, and let her feel the outline of my solitude. My anger at my grandfather’s cowardice. My grief for my mother, which was a sharp, private shard, not the town’s soft, generalized melancholy. My determination, which was ambition, and ambition was a selfish flame.
Her eyes snapped open. “There,” she breathed, her voice strained. “It is small. A knot of… want. It is not a want for comfort, or for peace, or even for understanding. It is a want for… agency. A want to be the author. It is a dry, hot little stone in your chest. It has no echo here. We are all scribes, copying from the same text. You want to write your own.”
It was the most accurate thing anyone had ever said about me.
“Can you guide me to a thread that conflicts with it? A memory, a feeling the town has given me that this ‘want’ rejects?”
She nodded, sweat beading at her temples. The effort was immense. She was using the confluence’s own sensor to find its point of failure. “The strongest… it is your memory of the river. The day you arrived. The town felt your grief for your mother, your loneliness. It gave you back… a sense of belonging. A warmth. A feeling that you were home, that your sorrow was recognized. It is a beautiful, generous thread.”
“And?”
“And your ‘want’… your agency… it hates it. It rejects that gift as a presumption. As a theft of your private grief. It whispers that the sorrow is yours to own, not to share. That the belonging is a cage, not a comfort.” She looked ill. “To cut that thread… it would be an act of profound ingratitude. It would hurt. It would make you less… connected. More alone.”
“I know,” I said. “That’s the point.”
I took the needle from my pocket. Not the delicate memory needle, but a thicker, blunter instrument from my kit—a biocircuitry probe. I would not be editing a memory. I would be severing a feedback loop. I filled its reservoir not with a chemical suppressant, but with a concentrated neural inhibitor, keyed to the specific emotional frequency Aunty Mala described.
“Where?” I asked.
She reached out, her hand trembling, and touched her fingertips to my temple, just above the hairline. “Here. It is an ingress point. A place where the shared feeling was offered and… accepted, even as your core resisted.”
I didn’t hesitate. I brought the probe to the spot. The contact was cold. I took a breath, holding the ‘want’—the dry, hot stone of my agency—in my mind. I focused on its rejection of the river’s false comfort, its insistence on the sanctity of my own, un-shared pain.
I activated the probe.
There was no pain. Not physically. But a soundless snap echoed through my psyche. It was the sound of a taut string breaking. The warm, grateful feeling associated with the river memory—the sense of being embraced, understood, *home*—did not vanish. It simply… disconnected from me. It became a historical fact. *The town gave you this feeling.* It was no longer *I feel this feeling.* The memory remained, but its emotional charge, the gift-wrap of belonging, fell away. What was left was the raw data: the black water, the stilt-house lights, my own exhaustion, the weight of the urn. My private desolation, returned to me.
A gasp went through the coffee shop. Not a loud one. A collective, soft intake of breath, as if everyone had felt a sudden, localized draft. Aunty Mala jerked her hand back from my temple as if burned. Her face was ashen.
“What have you done?” she murmured.
I felt… light. And cold. A specific, intimate cold. The riverbank was now just a place I had been sad. The town’s compassion was now just a thing they had done. A space had opened up around my grief, a silent, empty room where only I lived.
I looked at Aunty Mala. I saw her fear, her confusion, her dawning horror at what I represented—not an anomaly to be excised, but a surgeon operating on the body of the town itself.
“I have defined a boundary,” I said, my voice sounding strangely clear in my own ears. “One thread.”
It was a proof of concept. A tiny cut. But the blade had worked. I could see the seam now. I could see how the confluence was woven into me, a tapestry of borrowed feelings. And I knew, with a certainty that was itself gloriously, terrifyingly singular, that I could cut them all.
But the cost was written on Aunty Mala’s face. The cost was this new, profound loneliness, a solitude that was not a peaceful silence like my mother’s, but a conscious, aching separation. To be a knife was to be alone with your edge.
I stood up. The room seemed sharper, the colors more vivid, the noises more distinct and separate from one another. The comforting hum of the confluence was now a distinct murmur *outside* me. I was inside my own skin, for the first time since I’d stepped off the train.
“Thank you, Aunty.”
She could only stare, her weathervane soul spinning in a wind it could not parse.
I walked out of the yellow cave of the coffee shop and into the bruised night. The thousand broken reflections of light on the river were just that now—reflections. Not symbols of shared beauty, just physics. I had my blade. I had my method.
And as I turned toward the clinic, toward the heart of the mechanism, I knew Rao would have felt it too. Not a tear in the weave, but a precise, surgical incision. He would have felt the birth of a new kind of silence in his beloved system—not a passive absence, but an active, cutting presence.
The locksmith would know the knife had come for him.

# Chapter 23

## **Chapter 23**

The clinic was a sleeping animal. Its windows were dark, blind eyes, and the sign that read *Klinik Desa* swung on a single rusted chain, ticking back and forth like a failing heart. The air was different now. It did not press against me with the humid weight of shared sentiment. It was just air, carrying the scent of damp earth and the distant, chemical tang from the processing plant. I could parse them. Diesel. Decaying frangipani. My own sweat, sharp with adrenaline. Separate notes, no longer a chord.

I had defined a boundary. One thread. The relief was a physical vacancy in my chest, a hollow where a borrowed, parasitic sorrow had lived. The grief was still there, of course—my mother’s absence was a geography inside me, a range of mountains I would always live among—but it was mine. Its contours were familiar, its weather patterns known. It did not have the sticky, foreign texture of the town’s sadness. I had cut that away.

And in cutting it, I had felt the structure of the confluence. Not as a fog, but as a lattice. A meticulous, invisible architecture of feeling, each strand tied to a place, a person, a memory that was not my own. I saw how it was woven through me, a thousand fine sutures holding a borrowed skin to my bones. The surgeon’s clarity was cold and brilliant. I could cut them all.

But the cost was the silence. Not my mother’s peaceful, chosen silence. This was the silence of a quarantine ward. The murmur of the town was still there, a low hum just beyond a thick pane of glass. I could hear it, but I could not feel its temperature. I was inside my own skin, and my skin was a membrane that now kept things out. The sensation was one of exquisite, terrifying exposure. I was a single nerve, un-buffered.

The clinic door was unlocked.

It sighed inward on oiled hinges, a detail that felt obscenely normal. The reception area was a pool of shadow, the plastic chairs empty sentinels. The faint green glow of a power strip illuminated the legs of the front desk. I did not turn on the light. My eyes adjusted, pulling shapes from the dark: the filing cabinet, the poster about dengue prevention, the small wooden rack of pamphlets. *Kesihatan Mental*, one read. Mental Health.

I moved past it, down the short corridor to Rao’s office. The door was ajar.

He was waiting for me. He sat behind his desk, not in his usual slouch of scholarly abstraction, but upright, his hands flat on the blotter. The only light came from the brass Anglepoise lamp on his desk, its beam a tight cone that illuminated his hands, the open ledger before him, and the lower half of his face. His eyes were in shadow.

“You have performed an amputation,” he said. His voice was dry, clinical, but it vibrated with a profound, wounded tension. The sound of a master mechanic hearing a fundamental gear in his life’s work shearing off.

I stopped in the doorway. “I excised a foreign body.”

“Semantics. You have introduced a discontinuity. A localized silence. I felt it propagate. A tiny, perfect nullity where there was once a… resonance.” He leaned forward slightly, and the light caught the gleam in his eyes. Not anger. A horrified fascination. “How?”

“I remembered her,” I said. The words were simple stones dropped into the dark room. “I remembered her as she was. Not as the town needed her to be. Not as a symbol of loss. As my mother. The woman who hated having her seatbelt fastened.”

He was very still. “And that was enough? A personal memory?”

“It was a true one. It had edges. It didn’t blend. It was mine.” I took a step into the room. The air was close, smelling of old paper and the sandalwood soap he used. “You built this place on borrowed feeling. On consensus. You smoothed out the edges of every individual grief, every private joy, to make a… paste. A spiritual *rojak*. You called it harmony.”

“It *is* harmony,” he said, and for the first time, a crack of defensiveness showed. “It is the end of loneliness. The end of the unbearable, isolating weight of the self.”

“It is the end of the self,” I corrected. My voice was that clear, strange instrument from the coffee shop. “You traded singularity for comfort. You asked them to forget what was uniquely theirs, so they could share what was generically painful. You are not a locksmith. You are a forger. You make copies with no original.”

He flinched. The lamp’s beam trembled. “You think your loneliness is superior? This… this atomic isolation you have carved for yourself? You have traded a living tapestry for a bare, cold wall.”

“I have traded a fiction for a fact.” I was circling the truth now, the blade in my mind turning, seeking the central seam. “My mother’s death was my fact. Not the town’s. You used it. You took my raw, specific grief and you… laundered it. You fed it into your system to power the general melancholy. To keep the engine of gentle sadness running. Her death became a public utility.”

“It was honored!” he snapped, his composure shredding. “It was given meaning! It was absorbed and transformed so that her passing would not be a sterile, meaningless event in a vacuum! It became part of the living memory of the place!”

“It became *your* memory,” I said, and the final piece clicked into place, cold and sharp. “That’s the mechanism, isn’t it? It’s not *their* shared memory at all. It’s yours. You’re the filter. You’re the processor. You feel everything first, don’t you? Every raw, unprocessed emotion. The death, the betrayal, the shame from the processing plant, the young love by the river. You feel it all, in its pure, undiluted, agonizing form. And you can’t bear it.”

His breath hitched. A small, almost imperceptible sound.

So I continued, the shape of his prison becoming clear to me. “You built this confluence not to save them from loneliness. You built it to save yourself from feeling. You take the specific, sharp, singular pain of individuals, and you diffuse it. You spread it out across hundreds of minds, watering it down into a general, ambient mood. A manageable sadness. A vague nostalgia. You don’t lock away their memories. You *dilute* them. You turn vintage wine into tap water so you can drink it without drowning. They get a faint, shared echo. You get relief from the unbearable intensity of being the only true empath in a town of sleepwalkers.”

He did not deny it. He looked down at his ledger, at the columns of names and dates and coded notations. A log of emotions processed. A ledger of spiritual debt. “You make it sound monstrous,” he whispered.

“It is a kind of monstrosity. A beautiful, compassionate monstrosity.” I felt no rage at him. Only a vast, surgical pity. “You are the true ghost here. Haunted by everyone else’s feelings. And you have made the whole town a haunted house to keep yourself company.”

“And what is your solution?” he asked, looking up. The light now showed his face fully. He was exhausted, etched with a fatigue decades deep. “To make everyone like you? A nation of islands? Of scalpels, cutting themselves free? You have cut one thread and you already wear the loneliness like a lead coat. Could a baker bear it? A fisherman? Could Aunty Mala? You would condemn them to the full, crushing weight of their own un-shared lives?”

“I would give them back the weight,” I said. “It belongs to them. It is the cost of the love they actually had, not the communal ghost-love you provide. You have given them an anesthetic. I am proposing a surgery. It will hurt. It will be unbearable for some. But it will be *theirs*.”

He shook his head slowly, a man seeing a beloved equation dissolve. “They will break.”

“Some might,” I acknowledged. The image of Aunty Mala’s horrified face flashed before me. The cost. “Or they might finally begin to heal. Truly heal. Not just… manage the symptoms.”

We stared at each other across the pool of light. Two opposing theories of salvation. The harmonizer and the surgeon.

“You have come to dismantle it,” he stated.

“I have come to give them a choice,” I said. “A real one. Not the false choice between your harmony and chaos, but a choice between a shared dream and their own, real, difficult waking life.”

“And how will you do that?” A faint, grim curiosity touched his voice. “You have cut one thread. A remarkable feat. But the confluence is not a sweater you can unravel. It is a living system. It is woven into the land, into the routines, into the very neural pathways of the people here. To cut it all would be… a psychic massacre. You would have to hold the specific, true memory of every single borrowed feeling, every diluted sorrow and joy, and sever it from the communal pool. Simultaneously. You would have to become the mirror to my filter. You would have to feel it all, in its specific, undiluted form, just as I once did, and *not* diffuse it. You would have to bear the full, unmediated agony of this entire town, all at once. You would shatter. Your ‘blade’ would melt in the fire.”

He was right. I saw it immediately. The logical end of my path. I could make a single, precise cut by focusing on one true, private memory. But to dismantle the entire structure, I would need to hold the unique truth of hundreds of lives against the false, blended memory the confluence provided. I would have to become the crucible for every raw emotion he had spent a lifetime diluting. I would have to remember for everyone.

The scale of it was apocalyptic. It was not a surgery. It was a sacrifice.

“You see,” he said softly, reading the understanding on my face. “We are not so different. You propose to take the burden from them, and onto yourself. I proposed to take the burden from myself, and spread it amongst them. We are both thieves of feeling. We just have different methods of redistribution.”

The truth of it was a cold stone in my gut. He was a forger. I aspired to be a martyr. Neither role was clean. Neither role was whole.

“There has to be a third way,” I said, but the words sounded weak, theoretical. The surgeon’s clarity was blurring, confronted with a disease that was also the patient’s circulatory system.

“There isn’t,” Rao said, with the finality of a man who had spent thirty years looking for exits and finding only deeper rooms in the maze. “This is the paradox. True feeling is isolating. Shared feeling is diluted. You can have the purity of solitude, or the comfort of the collective. You cannot have both. I chose comfort. You are choosing purity. The town never chose. The town was given a gift, wrapped in a lie.”

He closed the ledger. The sound was like the closing of a tomb.

“So what will you do, surgeon?” he asked. “Perform the operation that will kill the patient? Or walk away, knowing the patient is living a sedated half-life?”

I had no answer. The blade in my mind was still, its purpose suddenly ambiguous. To cut was to inflict a pain I might not survive, and that the town might not withstand. To not cut was to leave them in a beautiful, consensual dream, a dream where my mother’s death was a public park and not a private, jagged cliff.

I turned from the light, from his waiting, exhausted face. I walked back down the dark corridor, through the reception where the pamphlet on mental health was a pale square in the gloom, and out into the night.

The town was quiet. The river was a black ribbon stitched with faint, reflected stars. I stood on the small porch, the wood cool under my bare feet. The murmur of the confluence was there, a psychic tinnitus. I had thought my new silence was a victory. Now it felt like a prelude to a greater, more terrible silence I might have to impose.

I began to walk, not with purpose, but with a need to move. The streets were empty. The shophouses were sealed, their shutters drawn. I passed the coffee shop, a dark cave. I passed the empty jetty. My feet carried me on the familiar path, up the slight incline, past the whispering trees, to the small, fenced plot on the outskirts.

The cemetery.

The moonlight washed the graves in a blue silver. The granite headstones looked like worn teeth. The air here had a different quality—not the humid embrace of the town, but a thinner, older stillness. This was where the confluence felt weakest, where the borrowed feelings thinned out, faced with the final, un-sharable fact of the body in the ground.

I went to the new plot. The raw earth was still mounded, not yet settled. There was no headstone, only a simple wooden marker with a name painted in careful white: *CHUA LI LING*. My mother’s name. The public fact of her.

But beside it, on the grass, was something else.

A small, familiar object. The celadon urn.

It sat there, looking absurd and profound. Someone had placed it here, carefully, at the head of her grave. Not buried, not enshrined. Just… placed. As if waiting.

I knelt. The dew soaked through the knees of my trousers. I touched the urn’s glaze. It was cool, beaded with moisture. This was the vessel that had carried her ashes from KL, that had sat buckled in the train seat, that had held the physical fact of her end. The town had no claim on this object. It was entirely mine. And yet, here it was.

I understood then. This was the choice, made physical. The urn above ground, or the ashes within it, buried. The symbol, or the fact. The shared memory, or the private one. I could not have both. To let her be part of the town’s story was to keep her ashes in the urn, a relic. To let her be entirely my mother was to empty the urn into the earth, to let the rain and the roots take her, to make her memory as specific and unreachable as a single grain of soil.

I cradled the urn in my lap. I had thought the choice was about the town. But it began here. With her. With me.

Could I bury her? Truly, finally? Could I relinquish the last physical proof, consign her to the complete, unobserved silence of the earth? It would be the final cut. The deepest one. To do so would be to accept that her memory lived only in me, a fading, imperfect, singular record. It would be to embrace the ultimate loneliness of being the sole keeper of a lost world.

Or I could keep the urn. Keep her ashes contained, a monument. Something that could, in theory, be shared. A focus for the story. A part of the tapestry.

The moon passed behind a cloud, plunging the graves into deeper shadow. In that darkness, I felt the immensity of the choice not as a thought, but as a physical pressure. It was the choice Rao had described, reduced to its essence: purity, or comfort. Letting go, or holding on. The self, or the collective.

I sat with the cold weight in my lap until the sky began to lighten, from black to indigo to a sickly grey at the horizon. The dawn was not a clean break, but a slow seepage of light, revealing the world in all its granular, unkind detail. The chipped paint on the wooden marker. The individual blades of grass, each bent under its own drop of dew. The grain of the ceramic under my thumb.

I stood. My body was stiff, my mind scraped hollow. I looked from the urn to the raw earth of the grave.

And I knew my decision.

It was not an answer. It was a direction. A first cut of a different kind. I would start with her. I would start with the one memory that was mine to truly keep, or mine to truly surrender.

I walked back into the town as it was waking. Lights flickered on in shophouse upstairs rooms. The smell of charcoal and frying dough began to seep into the air. The murmur of the confluence strengthened with the waking minds, a rising tide of shared morning fatigue and small, anticipated pleasures.

I carried the urn through the streets, no longer trying to hide it. I saw the looks. The baker rolling up his shutters paused, his eyes going from my face to the vessel in my arms. The old man sweeping the steps of the sundry shop stopped his broom. Aunty Mala was not at her coffee shop; the door was still locked, the chairs still on the tables.

They saw the urn. They felt its significance through the confluence—a sharp, specific object of loss moving through their blended morning mood. It was a stone dropped into their pond. I felt the ripples not as emotions, but as a disturbance in the field, a localized warping of the general haze. They were noticing. Not with their minds, but with the shared soul Rao had built for them.

I was not the surgeon yet. I was the scalpel itself, being carried toward the operating theatre.

I reached the clinic as the sun broke the horizon, staining the river the color of dried blood. Rao was standing in the doorway, as if he had been waiting all night. He looked at the urn in my arms, then at my face. He saw my decision there. Not the full plan, but the commitment.

“You cannot do it alone,” he said, his voice rough with lack of sleep. “The system will reject you. It will defend itself. The weight of their need for comfort, their fear of being alone… it is a tidal force. You will need an anchor. A true memory that is not yours to hold you to the shore. Otherwise, you will be swept away into their dream forever, or shattered against the rocks of their collective unconscious.”

He was not trying to stop me. He was diagnosing the problem. The locksmith, explaining the lock one last time.

“I know,” I said.

“Do you have one?” he asked. “A memory strong enough? True enough?”

I thought of my mother’s hands, shaping *pau* dough. The specific, dry warmth of her palm against my forehead when I was sick. The way she said my name, not the English one, but the Hokkien one, with a particular inflection that existed nowhere else in the universe.

“I have mine,” I said.

“It may not be enough,” he said. “Your memory is your blade. But to perform this surgery, you will also need a… a suture. Something to close the wound you will make, or the patient will bleed out into madness. You need a memory of connection. Of a love that was real, and difficult, and *chosen*. Not inherited. Not blended. A singular love between two singular people.”

I stared at him. He was talking about a memory I did not have. A memory that was not mine to wield.

He looked past me, up the street. Following his gaze, I turned.

Aunty Mala was walking toward us. She moved slowly, as if against a great wind. Her face was pale, her eyes wide and fixed on me. She was not being pulled by the confluence. She was fighting it. She was holding a boundary of her own, a terrified, fragile one. In her hands, she carried something.

A small, lacquered box. Old, the black lacquer cracked in a fine web, the brass fittings green with age.

She stopped a few feet away, her breath coming in short gasps. She looked from me to Rao, and in her face was the terror of someone stepping off a cliff.

“You asked me,” she said to me, her voice a thin wire, “what I remembered. About the boy. About the river.” She held out the box. “I lied. I do remember. I remember everything. I have kept it. Here. For forty years.”

She was offering it to me. Not to share. To use. The last true memory in a town of echoes. A singular, painful, private love.

The anchor. The suture.

I looked at the urn in my arms. I looked at the box in her trembling hands.

The surgery was no longer a theory. It had its tools. It had its price. And it had its moment, rushing toward us now with the rising sun.

I reached out, and took the box from her.

Its weight was nothing. Its weight was everything.

**END OF CHAPTER 23**

# Chapter 24

## **Chapter 24**

The lacquered box was cold. It did not feel like wood, but like a piece of riverbed stone, smoothed by a century of patient water. I held it in one hand, my mother’s urn cradled in the crook of my other arm. Two vessels. One held what was left of a body, reduced to mineral and carbon. The other held the ghost of a feeling, preserved in the amber of a shameful, perfect memory. The weight distribution was all wrong. The urn was heavier, but the box pulled at me with a deeper gravity.

Aunty Mala’s hands, now empty, fluttered to her mouth. Her eyes were wells of old, still water, and the thing she had just dropped into them—this truth—was sending ripples down through decades, stirring up silt from the bottom. She had not given me a story. She had given me a live nerve, freshly exposed.

“It is not a happy memory,” she whispered, the words fraying at the edges. “It is… surgical. Precise. It cut me. It cut him. It is the only thing that was ever entirely ours.”

Rao let out a long, slow breath, the sound of a man seeing a dangerous, necessary calculation finally complete itself. “The suture must be strong enough to hold the flesh of a world together. It must be clean. It must be true. Pain is a sterilizing agent.”

The confluence around us was changing. The pressure had not lessened, but its character had shifted. It was no longer a chaotic riptide pulling in all directions. It was organizing. Focusing. The whispers from the open windows, the half-heard arguments, the fragments of radio songs—they began to weave into a single, low drone, a harmonic of collective anticipation. The town was a patient on a table, and the instruments were now laid out.

“Where?” I asked. My voice sounded foreign to me, stripped of all inflection. It was the voice of the conductor on the train, asking for a ticket.

“The river,” Rao said. “The source of the forgetting. The place where the story broke. You must stand in the break and mend it.”

Aunty Mala shook her head, a frantic, tiny motion. “I cannot go there. I have not… I have not been to that bend since that day.”

“You don’t have to,” I said. The understanding arrived fully formed, a cold clarity. “You’ve already given the memory. You’ve already gone there, for forty years, every day. Carrying it. That’s enough.”

She looked at me then, really looked at me, and I saw not the formidable keeper of the shop, nor the frightened woman holding a secret, but someone impossibly young, trapped behind the lines of her own face. She gave a single, sharp nod, then turned and walked back toward her shop, her steps unsteady but deliberate. She was retreating to her post, to witness whatever came next from behind her counter, with her jars of sweets and her ledger of debts. It was where she belonged.

Rao and I were left alone in the street. The dawn light was strengthening, turning from bruised purple to a sickly, watery yellow. It did not feel like a beginning.

“Walk with me,” he said.

We did not speak as we left the main street and took the narrow path behind the shophouses, the one that led down to the river. The air grew damp and cool. The sound of the water came first as a suggestion, then a murmur, then a clear, rushing conversation over stone. The path was overgrown with ferns and the creeping roots of angsana trees, their branches forming a tunnel that dripped with last night’s condensation. It was a forgotten road to a forgotten place.

My mind was not a whirlwind. It was a still, dark pool. I was not thinking of the procedure, of the mechanics of wielding one memory as a blade and another as a thread. I was thinking of the train. The smell of diesel and dried squid. The celadon urn strapped ridiculously into the seat. The conductor’s indifferent fingers. I had been waiting for a sign, for the world to acknowledge the cataclysm of my mother’s reduction to ash.

This was the sign. Not a crack of thunder, but a silent, gathering pressure. Not a ghostly whisper, but the weight of a lacquered box. The world did not acknowledge with fanfare. It acknowledged by presenting you with a task that only your specific, private devastation could complete.

We reached the riverbank. It was not the broad, muddy flow near the jetty, but a narrower, quicker stretch where the water curled around a large, mossy boulder before disappearing into a thicker grove of bamboo. The air hummed. It was not the drone of the town, but a higher, tighter frequency, like the sound inside a seashell amplified a thousand times. The light here was strange, fractured, as if seen through old, flawed glass. This was the place. The fracture in the lens.

Rao stopped at the edge of the trees. “I cannot cross with you. This boundary is yours to draw. The surgery is yours to perform. I am only the one who diagnosed the disease and handed you the scalpel.” He nodded to the urn. “You will need her. Not as anchor. As… compass. To find your way back to yourself, when the memory you are about to enter threatens to become you.”

I understood. The memory in the box was not mine. To use it, I would have to become its vessel, to let it flow through me as if it were my own experience. The risk was dissolution. Losing myself in Aunty Mala’s past. My mother, in her urn, was the fixed point. The *here* and *now* to which I had to return.

I stepped past him, onto the smooth, grey stones of the riverbank. The hum intensified, vibrating in my teeth. I set the urn down carefully on a flat rock, turning it so the simple, glazed surface faced me. Then I looked at the box.

There was no latch. The lid was sealed shut by time and old lacquer. I pried at it with my fingernails. It did not budge. I was not meant to open it. I was meant to *remember* it.

I closed my eyes, my fingers resting on the cool, cracked lacquer. I thought not of Aunty Mala, but of the boy. The Chinese boy with the quiet smile who loved books and hated fishing. The boy whose name had been erased from the town’s ledger. I held the idea of him in my mind, and I pressed.

The box opened.

Not in my hands. In my mind.

***
It was not a flood. It was an immersion.

One moment I was standing on the riverbank, the chill morning air on my skin. The next, I was drenched in a late afternoon heat so thick it was like breathing soup. The smell of hot mud, of wet hemp, of my own sweat—*her* sweat—was overwhelming. I was in her body. Seventeen. My heart was a wild, frantic bird in my chest. I held a book. *The Collected Poems of Tennyson*, its cloth cover soft and worn at the edges.

I was waiting.

The knowledge was cellular. The fear was a bright, sharp wire running from my throat to my stomach. The excitement was a deeper, warmer thrum beneath it. We were not supposed to be here. We were not supposed to be *anywhere* together. His family’s shop was three streets away from mine, and the distance might as well have been an ocean. We had no common language but the broken, formal English taught in school, and the silent, fluent language of glances held a second too long, of fingers brushing when passing a borrowed book.

He came through the bamboo, quiet as a shadow. He was taller than me, slender, his white shirt rolled to his elbows. His face, when he saw me, did not break into a smile. It softened, as if a constant, low-grade tension had finally released. That was the first thing I—*she*—loved. That she could soften him.

“Mala,” he said. The name was a breath. He never called me ‘Aunty’. It was always just Mala. A singular address.

“Wen,” I said. The name was a secret. I held out the book. “I finished it.”

He took it, our fingers touching. The contact was a jolt, a live current in the heavy air. “And?”

“I liked ‘Ulysses’. ‘To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.’” The words felt brave in my mouth.

He nodded, looking at the river. “It is a poem for leaving. Not for staying.”

“Do you want to leave?” The question was dangerous.

He looked at me then, and his eyes were full of a sadness so profound it felt ancient. “I want to not have to choose between leaving and… this.” *This*. Us. The stolen hour by the river. The hidden notes. The entire, fragile architecture of our secret.

He sat on the boulder, and I sat beside him, not touching, but the space between us was charged, alive. He opened the book, not to read, but to take out a folded piece of paper tucked between the pages. A letter. He had written me a letter. In English. It was a language not our own, a neutral territory where we could meet.

“Read it later,” he said, his voice tight.

I took it, my hand trembling. The paper was warm from the book, from his pocket. It was the most precious thing I had ever been given.

We sat in silence for a long time, listening to the river. The silence was not empty. It was full. It was the space where everything we could not say gathered and grew solid. I felt his shoulder next to mine. I felt the heat of his skin through our clothes. The world narrowed to this point: the pressure of his arm against mine, the sound of his breathing, the faint smell of ink and sandalwood on him.

Then, he spoke. Not looking at me. “My father has made an arrangement. A marriage. A girl from Ipoh. Her family is in textiles. It is… a good match.”

The words did not make sense at first. They were just sounds. Then they arranged themselves into meaning, and the meaning was a cold stone dropping into the well of my stomach. The wire of fear pulled taut.

I said nothing. What was there to say? Congratulations? My throat closed.

He turned to me. His eyes were bright. Not with tears, but with a fierce, desperate intensity. “I have told him no.”

The stone lifted, floated. “What did he say?”

“He said I have no choice. He said I am a son. He said this is not a story. This is a business.” His voice broke on the last word. “He said I must forget this… this childish fantasy.”

The word ‘fantasy’ hung in the air between us, ugly and small. What we had was not a fantasy. It was the most real thing in my life. It was the axis on which my world turned. It was the quiet, secret room inside me where I could finally be just *Mala*, not a daughter, not a future wife, not a debt to be paid.

“What will you do?” I whispered.

He took my hand. His palm was damp, his grip strong. “There is a cousin. In Singapore. He says I can work for him. In a shop. It is not… it is not what my father wants. But it is a life.”

He was offering it to me. Not in words, but in the desperate pressure of his fingers. He was offering a life of exile. Of scandal. Of being cut off from everything we knew. A life where the only thing we would have was each other, and the weight of what we had sacrificed.

I looked at our joined hands. My dark skin against his lighter skin. The differences were not just skin deep. They were in our gods, our ancestors, our food, our festivals. They were in the expectations that sat on our shoulders like stone carvings. To choose him was to choose to carry those stones, forever.

I loved him. The feeling was not a sweet, gentle thing. It was a sharp, painful, glorious certainty. It was the suture.

I lifted my head. I looked into his eyes. “Yes.”

The word was simple. It was the most complex thing I had ever uttered. It was a vow. It was a betrayal. It was a beginning and an end.

He let out a shuddering breath, and then he kissed me. It was not a gentle first kiss. It was a claiming and a surrender. It was salt from unshed tears and the promise of a future built on a cliff’s edge. It was singular. It was ours.

When we parted, the world had changed. The colours were brighter, the river’s song clearer. We had made a decision. We had chosen. We had a plan. He would write to his cousin. I would save what little money I could. We would meet here, in two weeks’ time, with our things. We would take the night train south.

We sat for a while longer, planning in hushed, exhilarated whispers. The sun began to dip, casting long, golden fingers through the bamboo. We had to go. Separately. As always.

He stood, pulling me up. He held both my hands. “Two weeks,” he said, each word a pledge.

“Two weeks,” I echoed.

He kissed my forehead, a tender, sealing kiss. Then he turned and disappeared into the bamboo, the green swallowing him whole.

I stood there, clutching the letter to my chest. The memory of the kiss burned on my lips. The future, for the first time, was not a pre-written script. It was a blank page, and we would write it together. I was terrified. I was exhilarated. I was *alive*.

I turned to go home, to begin the long, secret countdown.

That was the memory. The pure, painful, chosen love. The suture.

And it was a lie.

***
The memory did not end. It shattered.

The perspective wrenched, twisted. I was no longer *in* Mala. I was hovering, a ghost watching a ghost.

I saw her walk back along the path, her steps light, almost dancing. She was halfway to the town when she heard the shouts. Not angry shouts. Panicked shouts. A high, wailing cry that cut through the evening air.

She stopped. The colour drained from her face—*I felt it drain, a cold wash*—and she began to run, not toward home, but back toward the river, toward where the shouts were converging.

The scene at the bend was chaos. Men from the town, both Malay and Chinese, were gathered at the water’s edge. Someone was in the river, thrashing. Someone else was pulling a body onto the rocks.

It was Wen’s younger brother, Ah Liang, gasping and crying. On the rocks, limp and waterlogged, was Wen.

Mala froze at the edge of the trees. Her heart stopped. The world stopped.

The men were working on him, turning him over, pounding his back. Water gushed from his mouth. But he was still. So still.

“Foolish boy!” an old Chinese man was shouting. “Trying to show off! Swimming after the storm when the current is strong!”

“He was looking for something,” Ah Liang sobbed. “He said he dropped something. A book. He went in and… and the current took him…”

*A book*.

The letter. The letter she had tucked into her *baju*. It was safe. The book. *The Collected Poems of Tennyson*. He must have dropped it. He went back for it.

He went back for their secret, and the river, the indifferent, hungry river, took him.

She watched as they carried his body away. She watched as the life they had planned, the future they had chosen minutes before, was carried away with him. She did not scream. She did not move. She turned into a statue of grief, there in the shadows.

The days that followed were a blur of muffled sound and grey haze. The funeral. The closed, shuttered silence from his family’s shop. The whispers in the town. *Tragic. So young. A foolish accident.*

And through it all, the secret burned inside her like a coal. Their plan. Their choice. Their love. It had died with him. If she spoke of it, she would only compound her family’s shame and his family’s grief. She would turn their private, beautiful truth into a public, sordid scandal. She would rob his memory of the dignity of a simple, tragic accident.

So, she did the only thing she could think to do. She took the secret, and she buried it. Not in the ground, but in herself. She folded the letter, wrapped it in a piece of silk, and placed it in her mother’s old lacquer box. She sealed it shut. She locked the memory away, in a vault so deep and so dark that even she could barely find it.

And she began to forget. Not all at once, but in pieces. She forgot the exact shade of his eyes. She forgot the sound of his laugh. She forgot the feeling of his hand in hers. She let the town’s narrative—*a Chinese boy, drowned, a tragedy*—overwrite her own. She became Aunty Mala. She tended the shop. She kept the accounts. She remembered everyone’s debts. She forgot the one thing that was ever truly hers.

But the memory, buried alive, did not die. It festered. It sent out roots. It became the hidden fault line beneath the town. Her act of forgetting—so vast, so complete, born of a love so great she tried to sacrifice it to protect him—was an act of creation. It created the confluence. It taught the town how to forget. Her private, desperate surgery became the template for a communal disease.

***
I gasped, wrenching back into my own body on the riverbank. The cold morning air was a slap. I was on my knees. The lacquered box lay open on the stones before me, empty. The memory had been used, transferred, expended. It was gone from the box, and now it lived in me, a raw, fresh wound.

I understood now. The suture was not the happy memory. It was the *true* one. The one that contained the love *and* the loss, the choice *and* the consequence, the promise *and* the absolute, irrevocable end. It was a complete circuit. A memory strong enough to stitch reality back together had to be strong enough to almost break it.

I looked at the urn. My mother. My fixed point.

“I need the blade now,” I whispered to her, to myself.

I reached for the memory Rao had instructed me to forge. The memory of my mother’s love. Not the general, warm feeling, but a specific, surgical moment. I closed my eyes and I cut.

I did not choose a happy memory. I chose a real one.

I was nine. I had a fever that came on in the night, a furnace burning me up from the inside. She came into my room, her hair loose, her face soft with sleep. She did not feel my forehead. She placed her cool palm directly on my chest, over my pounding heart.

“*Ah girl*,” she murmured, my Hokkien name a sigh in the dark.

She left and returned with a bowl of cool water and a small, white cloth. She wrung it out and began to wipe my face, my neck, my arms. Her movements were not gentle, but they were precise. Efficient. There was no pity in her touch, only a fierce, focused determination to *fix*. To mend. She was battling the fever, and I was the territory over which they fought.

She talked to me as she worked, not sweet nothings, but stories. Sharp, funny stories about her own childhood, about stupid things my aunties had done, about the cunning old man who sold the best *kaya* in Penang. Her voice was a low, steady rhythm, a rope thrown to me in the choppy sea of my delirium.

After an hour, the fever broke. I was drenched in sweat, exhausted, but the terrible, burning pressure was gone. I started to shiver. She pulled the thin sheet over me, then lay down on the bed beside me, on top of the covers. She put her arm around me, pulling my damp, shivering body against her side. She was warm and solid. An anchor.

“Sleep,” she said. “The war is over. You won.”

I buried my face in the cotton of her nightdress, smelling the familiar scent of sun-dried fabric and her skin. It was not a moment of tender, sentimental love. It was a moment of alliance. Of two people—a mother and a daughter—who had faced down an enemy together and prevailed. Her love was not a blanket. It was a weapon, a tool, a fortress. It was chosen, every day, in acts of unglamorous, relentless defence.

That was my blade. A memory of love as a surgical, mending force.

I held it in my mind, honed to a fine, sharp edge. I held Aunty Mala’s memory of love-as-suture, still bleeding and raw within me.

I stood up. I faced the river, the fracture point.

The hum was now a deafening roar, a static scream of broken stories. The air shimmered like a heat haze, but it was cold. In that shimmer, I could see fragments: a man arguing with his father, the words dissolving into gibberish; a woman burning a letter, the smoke curling into the shape of a regret; a child dropping a precious shell into the water, the moment of loss repeating on a loop.

I stepped into the water. It was not wet. It was the temperature of nothing. Of absence.

I raised my blade—the memory of my mother’s mending—and I cut.

Not at the air. At the *story*. At the town’s foundational, broken narrative: *A Chinese boy drowned. A tragedy. Nothing more.*

I cut through the lie of simplicity. I cut through the enforced forgetting. I made an incision in the skin of the world.

The reaction was immediate. The shimmering air tore like fabric. A wail erupted from the tear, a composite of every stifled sob, every unsaid word, every swallowed truth in Kamunting’s history. It was not a human sound. It was the sound of a wound.

Through the tear, I saw the past not as a memory, but as a live nerve. I saw Wen’s body on the rocks. I saw Mala, watching from the trees, her future calcifying into grief before her eyes. I saw the moment of her decision to forget, a dark, powerful spell cast out of love and despair.

The wound gaped. The town’s madness—the confluence, the bleeding memories—began to rush toward it, a psychic haemorrhage. This was the danger. The patient would bleed out.

Now.

I took the suture—Aunty Mala’s true, painful, complete memory—and I began to sew.

I did not sew the wound shut with a happy ending. I did not resurrect Wen. I did not unite the lovers across time.

I sutured the truth into the gap.

I stitched the memory of their plan, their choice, their “yes” into the fabric of the town’s story. I stitched the weight of the lacquered box, the forty years of silent bearing. I stitched the love that was real, and difficult, and chosen, and lost. I stitched it not as a scandal, but as a fact. A tragic, beautiful, human fact that belonged to the history of this place as much as the rubber trees or the railway line.

With each psychic stitch, the wailing diminished. The shimmering air began to still. The fragmented visions sucked back into the tear, not erased, but re-ordered, placed into a coherent, if painful, timeline.

The river of forgetting slowed. Its waters, which had been choked with the debris of half-memories, began to run clear. The cold, absent feeling was replaced by the genuine chill of morning river water soaking through my shoes.

The tear sealed. The last stitch was the memory of Mala, old now, handing the box to me, her face a landscape of terror and relief. The suture was complete. The wound was closed. A scar remained—the knowledge of the true story—but the bleeding had stopped.

The silence that followed was absolute. It was not the dead silence of before, but a deep, clean quiet, like the moment after a storm has passed. The hum was gone. The pressure was gone. The air was just air. The light was just dawn light, pale and pure.

I stumbled back onto the bank, my legs buckling. I collapsed beside the rock where my mother’s urn sat, serene and unchanging. I was drenched in sweat and river water, trembling from an exhaustion that went down to the marrow of my bones. I felt hollowed out. I had used up the two most powerful memories I possessed, one borrowed, one my own. I was an empty vessel.

But the world… the world felt solid. The edges of things were crisp. The sound of the river was just water over stone, not a chorus of ghosts. The town behind me slept a normal, dreamless sleep.

I had performed the surgery. I had used memory not as a blanket or a weapon, but as a surgical tool. To cut. To suture. To mend.

I picked up the urn and held it to my chest. The celadon was cool and smooth. “*Ah girl*,” I whispered to myself, in her voice. “The war is over.”

I sat there until the sun cleared the trees, its light warm and ordinary on my skin. Then, I stood. I left the empty lacquered box on the riverbank. Its work was done. I walked back up the path, each step heavy but sure.

The town of Kamunting was waking up. A man was sweeping the steps of his shop. The smell of frying *roti canai* drifted from a window. A bicycle bell rang. It was all mundane. It was all miraculous.

I walked to the station. The morning train to Butterworth was waiting, huffing steam onto the platform. It smelled of diesel and hot metal. I bought a ticket from the same bored clerk. I found a seat by the window.

I placed my mother’s urn on the seat beside me. This time, I did not strap it in. I let it sit freely, a passenger in its own right.

The conductor came down the aisle. “Ticket, Miss.”

I handed it to him. His eyes flicked to the urn. Then back to me. For a fraction of a second, his practiced blankness faltered. He gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. Not of pity. Of acknowledgement. *Ah. You are carrying someone.*

It was the sign I had waited for, twenty-three hours ago on a different train. The world acknowledging a reduction, and the weight of what remains.

The whistle blew. The train jerked forward. I pressed my forehead against the cool glass, watching Kamunting bleed into a green smear, the world dissolving once more into a Monet of exhaustion and relief.

But I was not the same person who had arrived. I had come with ashes and an empty space where a memory should be. I was leaving with ashes, and a scar where a memory had been used. I had learned that identity is not the memories you keep, but the ones you are willing to wield. To cut. To suture. To mend.

The train picked up speed, carrying me south, toward the sea, toward whatever came next. The journey was complete. And just beginning.

My mother’s urn sat beside me, a simple, silent companion. She would have hated the sentimentality of it all. *Like a tourist*, she’d have sniffed.

I smiled. For the first time in a long time, I could hear her voice clearly. It was not a ghostly whisper. It was my own memory, sharp and sure and mine. It was enough.

The tracks clattered. The doors hissed. The murmur of Bahasa and Hokkien and Tamil wove through the carriage, a living tapestry of stories, whole and unbroken.

I closed my eyes, and I slept.
